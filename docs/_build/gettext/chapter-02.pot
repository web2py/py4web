msgid "We've made our best to make PY4WEB simple and clean. But you know, modern web programming is a daunting task. It requires an open mind, able to jump frequently (without being lost!) from python to HTML to javascript to css and even database management. But don't be scared, in this manual we'll assist you side by side in this journey. And there are many other valuable resources that we're going to show you."

msgid "In the following chapters you will start coding on your computer. We suggest you to setup a modern python workplace if you plan to do it efficiently and safely. Even for running simple examples and experimenting a little, we strongly suggest to use an **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE). This will make your programming experience much better, allowing syntax checking, linting and visual debugging. Nowadays there are two free and multi-platform main choices: Microsoft Visual Studio Code aka `VScode <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__ and JetBrains `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__."
