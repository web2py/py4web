====================================
The Database Abstraction Layer (DAL)
====================================

DAL introduction
----------------

py4web rely on a database abstraction layer (DAL), an API that maps
Python objects into database objects such as queries, tables, and
records. The DAL dynamically generates the SQL in real time using the
specified dialect for the database back end, so that you do not have to
write SQL code or learn different SQL dialects (the term SQL is used
generically), and the application will be portable among different types
of databases.
The DAL choosen is a pure Python one called `pyDAL <https://github.com/web2py/pydal>`__.
It was conceived in the web2py project but it's a standard python module:
you can use it in any Python context.

A little taste of pyDAL features:

- Transactions
- Aggregates
- Inner & Outer Joins
- Nested Selects

py4web model
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Even if web2py and py4web use the same pyDAL, there are important differences (see 
:ref:`From web2py to py4web` for details). The main caveat is that in py4web only
the action is executed for every HTTP request, while the code defined outside of
actions is only executed at startup. That makes py4web much faster, in particular
when there are many tables. The downside of this approach is that the developer
should be careful to never override pyDAL variables inside action or in any way
that depends on the content of the request object, else the code is not thread safe.
The only variables that can be changed at will are the following field attributes:
readable, writable, requires, update, and default.
All the others are for practical purposes to be considered global and non thread safe.

Supported databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A partial list of supported databases is show in the table
below. Please check on the py4web/pyDAL web site and mailing list for more
recent adapters.

.. note::

   In any modern python distribution **SQLite** is actually built-in as a Python library.
   The SQLite driver (sqlite3) is also included: you don't need to install it.
   Hence this is the most popular database for testing and development.

The Windows and the Mac binary distribution work out of the box with SQLite only.
To use any other database back end, run a full py4web
distribution and install the appropriate driver for the required back
end. Once the proper driver is installed, start py4web and it
will automatically find the driver.

Here is a list of the drivers py4web can use:

==========  ==========================================
Database    Drivers (source)
==========  ==========================================
SQLite      sqlite3 or pysqlite2 or zxJDBC (on Jython)
PostgreSQL  psycopg2 or zxJDBC (on Jython)
MySQL       pymysql or MySQLdb
Oracle      cx_Oracle
MSSQL       pyodbc or pypyodbc
FireBird    kinterbasdb or fdb or pyodbc
DB2         pyodbc
Informix    informixdb
Ingres      ingresdbi
Cubrid      cubriddb
Sybase      Sybase
Teradata    pyodbc
SAPDB       sapdb
MongoDB     pymongo
IMAP        imaplib
==========  ==========================================

Support of MongoDB is experimental. Google NoSQL is treated as a particular case.
The Gotchas_ section at the end of this chapter has some more information
about specific databases.

The DAL: a quick tour
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

py4web defines the following classes that make up the DAL:

DAL
   represents a database connection. For example:

   .. code:: python

      db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite')

Table
   represents a database table. You do not directly instantiate
   Table; instead, ``DAL.define_table`` does.

   .. code:: python

      db.define_table('mytable', Field('myfield'))

   The most important methods of a Table are:

   ``insert``, ``truncate``, ``drop``, and ``import_from_csv_file``.

Field
   represents a database field. It can be instantiated and passed
   as an argument to ``DAL.define_table``.

Rows
   is the object returned by a database select. It can be
   thought of as a list of ``Row`` rows:

   .. code:: python

      rows = db(db.mytable.myfield != None).select()

Row
   contains field values.

   .. code:: python

      for row in rows:
          print(row.myfield)

Query
   is an object that represents a SQL “where” clause:

   .. code:: python

      myquery = (db.mytable.myfield != None) | (db.mytable.myfield > 'A')

Set
   is an object that represents a set of records. Its most
   important methods are ``count``, ``select``, ``update``, and ``delete``.
   For example:

   .. code:: python

      myset = db(myquery)
      rows = myset.select()
      myset.update(myfield='somevalue')
      myset.delete()

Expression
   is something like an ``orderby`` or ``groupby``
   expression. The Field class is derived from the Expression. Here is an
   example.

   .. code:: python

      myorder = db.mytable.myfield.upper() | db.mytable.id
      db().select(db.table.ALL, orderby=myorder)

Using the DAL “stand-alone”
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

pyDAL is an independent python package. As such, it can be used
without the web2py/py4web environment; you just need to install
it with ``pip``. Then import the pydal module when needed:

.. code:: python

   >>> from pydal import DAL, Field


.. note::

   Even if you can import modules directly from pydal, this is not
   advisable from within py4web applications. Remember that ``py4web.DAL``
   is a fixture, ``pydal.DAL`` is not. In this context, the last command
   should better be:

   >>> from py4web import DAL, Field


Experiment with the py4web shell
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can also experiment with the pyDAL API using the py4web shell,
that is available using the :ref:`shell command option`.

.. warning::

   Mind that
   database changes may be persistent. So be careful and do NOT hesitate
   to create a new application for doing testing instead of tampering
   with an existing one.


Note that most of the code snippets that contain the python prompt
``>>>`` are also directly executable via a py4web shell.

This is a simple example, using the provided ``examples`` app:

.. code:: python

   >>> from py4web import DAL, Field
   >>> from apps.examples import db
   >>> db.tables()
   ['auth_user', 'auth_user_tag_groups', 'person', 'superhero', 'superpower', 'tag', 'product', 'thing']
   >>> rows = db(db.superhero.name != None).select()
   >>> rows.first()
   <Row {'id': 1, 'tag': <Set ("tag"."superhero" = 1)>, 'name': 'Superman', 'real_identity': 1}>

You can also start by creating a connection from zero. For the sake of simplicity, you
can use SQLite. Nothing in this discussion changes when you switch the back-end
engine.


DAL constructor
---------------

Basic use:

.. code:: python

   >>> db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite')

The database is now connected and the connection is stored in the global
variable ``db``.

At any time you can retrieve the connection string.

.. code:: python

   >>> db._uri
   sqlite://storage.sqlite

and the database name

.. code:: python

   >>> db._dbname
   sqlite

The connection string is called ``_uri`` because it is an instance of
a uniform resource identifier.

The DAL allows multiple connections with the same database or with
different databases, even databases of different types. For now, we will
assume the presence of a single database since this is the most common
situation.

DAL signature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. code:: python

   DAL(uri='sqlite://dummy.db',
       pool_size=0,
       folder=None,
       db_codec='UTF-8',
       check_reserved=None,
       migrate=True,
       fake_migrate=False,
       migrate_enabled=True,
       fake_migrate_all=False,
       decode_credentials=False,
       driver_args=None,
       adapter_args=None,
       attempts=5,
       auto_import=False,
       bigint_id=False,
       debug=False,
       lazy_tables=False,
       db_uid=None,
       do_connect=True,
       after_connection=None,
       tables=None,
       ignore_field_case=True,
       entity_quoting=False,
       table_hash=None)

Connection strings (the uri parameter)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A connection with the database is established by creating an instance of
the DAL object:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite')

``db`` is not a keyword; it is a local variable that stores the
connection object ``DAL``. You are free to give it a different name. The
constructor of ``DAL`` requires a single argument, the connection
string. The connection string is the only py4web code that depends on a
specific back-end database. Here are examples of connection strings for
specific types of supported back-end databases (in all cases, we assume
the database is running from localhost on its default port and is named
“test”):

====================  =======================================================
Database              Connection string
====================  =======================================================
**SQLite**            ``sqlite://storage.sqlite``
**MySQL**             ``mysql://username:password@localhost/test?set_encoding=utf8mb4``
**PostgreSQL**        ``postgres://username:password@localhost/test``
**MSSQL (legacy)**    ``mssql://username:password@localhost/test``
**MSSQL (>=2005)**    ``mssql3://username:password@localhost/test``
**MSSQL (>=2012)**    ``mssql4://username:password@localhost/test``
**FireBird**          ``firebird://username:password@localhost/test``
**Oracle**            ``oracle://username/password@test``
**DB2**               ``db2://username:password@test``
**Ingres**            ``ingres://username:password@localhost/test``
**Sybase**            ``sybase://username:password@localhost/test``
**Informix**          ``informix://username:password@test``
**Teradata**          ``teradata://DSN=dsn;UID=user;PWD=pass;DATABASE=test``
**Cubrid**            ``cubrid://username:password@localhost/test``
**SAPDB**             ``sapdb://username:password@localhost/test``
**IMAP**              ``imap://user:password@server:port``
**MongoDB**           ``mongodb://username:password@localhost/test``
**Google/SQL**        ``google:sql://project:instance/database``
**Google/NoSQL**      ``google:datastore``
**Google/NoSQL/NDB**  ``google:datastore+ndb``
====================  =======================================================

- in SQLite the database consists of a single file. If it does
  not exist, it is created. This file is locked every time it is accessed.
- in the case of MySQL, PostgreSQL, MSSQL, FireBird, Oracle, DB2, Ingres
  and Informix the database “test” must be created outside py4web. Once
  the connection is established, py4web will create, alter, and drop
  tables appropriately.
- in the MySQL connection string, the ``?set_encoding=utf8mb4`` at the end
  sets the encoding to UTF-8 and avoids an
  ``Invalid utf8 character string:`` error on Unicode characters that
  consist of four bytes, as by default, MySQL can only handle Unicode
  characters that consist of one to three bytes.
- in the Google/NoSQL case the ``+ndb`` option turns on NDB. NDB uses a
  Memcache buffer to read data that is accessed often. This is completely
  automatic and done at the datastore level, not at the py4web level.
- it is also possible to set the connection string to ``None``. In this
  case DAL will not connect to any back-end database, but the API can
  still be accessed for testing.

Some times you may also need to generate SQL as if you had a connection but
without actually connecting to the database. This can be done with

.. code:: python

   db = DAL('...', do_connect=False)

In this case you will be able to call ``_select``, ``_insert``,
``_update``, and ``_delete`` to generate SQL but not call ``select``,
``insert``, ``update``, and ``delete``; see `Generating raw SQL`_
for details. In most of the cases you can use
``do_connect=False`` even without having the required database drivers.

Notice that by default py4web uses utf8 character encoding for
databases. If you work with existing databases that behave differently,
you have to change it with the optional parameter ``db_codec`` like

.. code:: python

   db = DAL('...', db_codec='latin1')

Otherwise you’ll get UnicodeDecodeError tickets.

Connection pooling
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common argument of the DAL constructor is the ``pool_size``; it
defaults to zero.

As it is rather slow to establish a new database connection for each
request, py4web implements a mechanism for connection pooling. Once a
connection is established and the page has been served and the
transaction completed, the connection is not closed but goes into a
pool. When the next request arrives, py4web tries to recycle a
connection from the pool and use that for the new transaction. If there
are no available connections in the pool, a new connection is
established.

When py4web starts, the pool is always empty. The pool grows up to the
minimum between the value of ``pool_size`` and the max number of
concurrent requests. This means that if ``pool_size=10`` but our server
never receives more than 5 concurrent requests, then the actual pool
size will only grow to 5. If ``pool_size=0`` then connection pooling is
not used.

Connections in the pools are shared sequentially among threads, in the
sense that they may be used by two different but not simultaneous
threads. There is only one pool for each py4web process.

The ``pool_size`` parameter is ignored by SQLite and Google App Engine.
Connection pooling is ignored for SQLite, since it would not yield any
benefit.

Connection failures (attempts parameter)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If py4web fails to connect to the database it waits 1 second and by
default tries again up to 5 times before declaring a failure. In case of
connection pooling it is possible that a pooled connection that stays
open but unused for some time is closed by the database end. Thanks to
the retry feature py4web tries to re-establish these dropped
connections. The number of attempts is set via the attempts parameter.

Lazy Tables
~~~~~~~~~~~

Setting ``lazy_tables = True`` provides a major performance boost (but
not with py4web). It means that table creation is deferred until the
table is actually referenced.

.. warning::

   You should never use lazy tables in py4web. There is no advantage,
   no need, and possibly concurrency problems.

Model-less applications
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In py4web the code defined outside of actions (where normally DAL tables
are defined) is only executed at startup.

However, it is possible to define DAL tables on demand inside actions.
This is referred to as “model-less” development by the py4web community.

To use the “model-less” approach, you take responsibility for doing
all the housekeeping tasks. You call the table definitions when you
need them, and provide database connection passed as parameter.
Also, remember maintainability: other py4web developers expect to find
database definitions in the ``models.py`` file.

Replicated databases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The first argument of ``DAL(...)`` can be a list of URIs. In this case
py4web tries to connect to each of them. The main purpose for this is to
deal with multiple database servers and distribute the workload among
them. Here is a typical use case:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL(['mysql://...1', 'mysql://...2', 'mysql://...3'])

In this case the DAL tries to connect to the first and, on failure, it
will try the second and the third. This can also be used to distribute
load in a database master-slave configuration.

Reserved keywords
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``check_reserved`` tells the constructor to check table names and column
names against reserved SQL keywords in target back-end databases.
``check_reserved`` defaults to None.

This is a list of strings that contain the database back-end adapter
names.

The adapter name is the same as used in the DAL connection string. So if
you want to check against PostgreSQL and MSSQL then your db connection
would look as follows:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite', check_reserved=['postgres', 'mssql'])

The DAL will scan the keywords in the same order as of the list.

There are two extra options “all” and “common”. If you specify all, it
will check against all known SQL keywords. If you specify common, it
will only check against common SQL keywords such as ``SELECT``,
``INSERT``, ``UPDATE``, etc.

For supported back ends you may also specify if you would like to check
against the non-reserved SQL keywords as well. In this case you would
append ``_nonreserved`` to the name. For example:

.. code:: python

   check_reserved=['postgres', 'postgres_nonreserved']

The following database backends support reserved words checking.

==============  ==========================
Database        check_reserved
==============  ==========================
**PostgreSQL**  ``postgres(_nonreserved)``
**MySQL**       ``mysql``
**FireBird**    ``firebird(_nonreserved)``
**MSSQL**       ``mssql``
**Oracle**      ``oracle``
==============  ==========================

Database quoting and case settings
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Quoting of SQL entities are enabled by default in DAL, that is:

``entity_quoting = True``

This way identifiers are automatically quoted in SQL generated by DAL.
At SQL level keywords and unquoted identifiers are case insensitive,
thus quoting an SQL identifier makes it case sensitive.

   Notice that unquoted identifiers should always be folded to lower
   case by the back-end engine according to SQL standard but not all
   engines are compliant with this (for example PostgreSQL default
   folding is upper case).

By default DAL ignores field case too, to change this use:

``ignore_field_case = False``

To be sure of using the same names in python and in the DB schema, you
must arrange for both settings above. Here is an example:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL(ignore_field_case=False)
   db.define_table('table1', Field('column'), Field('COLUMN'))
   query = db.table1.COLUMN != db.table1.column

Making a secure connection
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes it is necessary (and advised) to connect to your database
using secure connection, especially if your database is not on the same
server as your application. In this case you need to pass additional
parameters to the database driver. You should refer to database driver
documentation for details.

For PostgreSQL with psycopg2 it should look like this:

.. code:: python

   DAL('postgres://user_name:user_password@server_addr/db_name',
       driver_args={'sslmode': 'require', 'sslrootcert': 'root.crt',
                    'sslcert': 'postgresql.crt', 'sslkey': 'postgresql.key'})

where parameters ``sslrootcert``, ``sslcert`` and ``sslkey`` should
contain the full path to the files. You should refer to PostgreSQL
documentation on how to configure PostgreSQL server to accept secure
connections.

Other DAL constructor parameters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Database folder location
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

``folder`` sets the place where migration files will be created (see
Migrations_ for details).
It is also used for SQLite databases. Automatically set within py4web.
Set a path when using DAL outside py4web.

Default migration settings
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The DAL constructor migration settings are booleans affecting defaults
and global behaviour.

``migrate = True`` sets default migrate behavior for all tables

``fake_migrate = False`` sets default fake_migrate behavior for all
tables

``migrate_enabled = True`` If set to False disables ALL migrations

``fake_migrate_all = False`` If set to True fake migrates ALL tables

``commit`` and ``rollback``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The insert, truncate, delete, and update operations aren't actually
committed until py4web issues the commit command. The create and drop
operations may be executed immediately, depending on the database
engine.

If you pass ``db`` in an ``action.uses`` decorator, you don't need to call
commit in the controller, it is done for you.  (Also, if you use
``authenticated`` or ``unauthenticated`` decorator.)

.. tip::

   always add ``db`` in an ``action.uses`` decorator (or use the
   ``authenticated`` or ``unauthenticated`` decorator).
   Otherwise you have to add ``db.commit()`` in every define_table and
   in every table activities: insert(), update(), delete()

So in actions there is normally no need to ever call
``commit`` or ``rollback`` explicitly in py4web unless you need more
granular control.

But if you executed commands via the shell, you are required
to manually commit:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.commit()

To check it let’s insert a new record:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.person.insert(name="Bob")
   2

and roll back, i.e., ignore all operations since the last commit:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.rollback()

If you now insert again, the counter will again be set to 2, since the
previous insert was rolled back.

.. code:: python

   >>> db.person.insert(name="Bob")
   2

Code in models, views and controllers is enclosed in py4web code that
looks like this (pseudo code):

.. code:: python

   try:
       execute models, controller function and view
   except:
       rollback all connections
       log the traceback
       send a ticket to the visitor
   else:
       commit all connections
       save cookies, sessions and return the page


Table constructor
-----------------

Tables are defined in the DAL via ``define_table``.

define_table signature
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The signature for define_table method is:

.. code:: python

   define_table(tablename, *fields, **kwargs)

It accepts a mandatory table name and an optional number of ``Field``
instances (even none). You can also pass a ``Table`` (or subclass)
object instead of a ``Field`` one, this clones and adds all the fields
(but the “id”) to the defining table. Other optional keyword args are:
``rname``, ``redefine``, ``common_filter``, ``fake_migrate``,
``fields``, ``format``, ``migrate``, ``on_define``, ``plural``,
``polymodel``, ``primarykey``, ``sequence_name``, ``singular``,
``table_class``, and ``trigger_name``, which are discussed below.

For example:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('person', Field('name'))
   <Table person (id, name)>

It defines, stores and returns a ``Table`` object called “person”
containing a field (column) “name”. This object can also be accessed via
``db.person``, so you do not need to catch the value returned by
define_table.

``id``: Notes about the primary key
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Do not declare a field called “id”, because one is created by py4web
anyway. Every table has a field called “id” by default. It is an
auto-increment integer field (usually starting at 1) used for
cross-reference and for making every record unique, so “id” is a primary
key. (Note: the id counter starting at 1 is back-end specific. For
example, this does not apply to the Google App Engine NoSQL.)

Optionally you can define a field of ``type='id'`` and py4web will use
this field as auto-increment id field. This is not recommended except
when accessing legacy database tables which have a primary key under a
different name. With some limitation, you can also use different primary
keys using the ``primarykey`` parameter.

``plural`` and ``singular``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

As pyDAL is a general DAL, it includes plural and singular attributes to
refer to the table names so that external elements can use the proper
name for a table.

``redefine``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tables can be defined only once but you can force py4web to redefine an
existing table:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person', Field('name'))
   db.define_table('person', Field('name'), redefine=True)

The redefinition may trigger a migration if table definition changes.

``format``: Record representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is optional but recommended to specify a format representation for
records with the ``format`` parameter.

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person', Field('name'), format='%(name)s')

or

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person', Field('name'), format='%(name)s %(id)s')

or even more complex ones using a function:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person', Field('name'),
                   format=lambda r: r.name or 'anonymous')

The format attribute will be used for two purposes:

- To represent referenced records in select/option drop-downs.
- To set the ``db.othertable.otherfield.represent`` attribute for all fields
  referencing this table. This means that the ``Form`` constructor will
  not show references by id but will use the preferred format
  representation instead.

``rname``: Real name
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``rname`` sets a database backend name for the table. This makes the
py4web table name an alias, and ``rname`` is the real name used when
constructing the query for the backend. To illustrate just one use,
``rname`` can be used to provide MSSQL fully qualified table names
accessing tables belonging to other databases on the server:
``rname = 'db1.dbo.table1'``

``primarykey``: Support for legacy tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``primarykey`` helps support legacy tables with existing primary keys,
even multi-part. See `Legacy databases and keyed tables`_.

``migrate``, ``fake_migrate``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``migrate`` sets migration options for the table. Refer to
`Migrations`_ for details.

``table_class``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you define your own table class as a sub-class of
pydal.objects.Table, you can provide it here; this allows you to extend
and override methods. Example:

.. code:: python

   from pydal.objects import Table

   class MyTable(Table):
       ...

   db.define_table(..., table_class=MyTable)

``sequence_name``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The name of a custom table sequence (if supported by the database). Can
create a SEQUENCE (starting at 1 and incrementing by 1) or use this for
legacy tables with custom sequences.

   Note that when necessary, py4web will create sequences automatically
   by default.

``trigger_name``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Relates to ``sequence_name``. Relevant for some backends which do not
support auto-increment numeric fields.

``polymodel``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

For use with Google App Engine.

``on_define``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~

``on_define`` is a callback triggered when a lazy_table is instantiated,
although it is called anyway if the table is not lazy. This allows
dynamic changes to the table without losing the advantages of delayed
instantiation.

Example:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL(lazy_tables=True)
   db.define_table('person',
       Field('name'),
       Field('age', 'integer'),
       on_define=lambda table: [
           table.name.set_attributes(requires=IS_NOT_EMPTY(), default=''),
           table.age.set_attributes(requires=IS_INT_IN_RANGE(0, 120), default=30) ])

Note this example shows how to use ``on_define`` but it is not actually
necessary. The simple ``requires`` values could be added to the Field
definitions and the table would still be lazy. However, ``requires``
which take a Set object as the first argument, such as IS_IN_DB, will
make a query like ``db.sometable.somefield == some_value`` which would
cause ``sometable`` to be defined early. This is the situation saved by
``on_define``.

Adding attributes to fields and tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

If you need to add custom attributes to fields, you can simply do this:
``db.table.field.extra = {}``

“extra” is not a keyword; it’s a custom attribute now attached to the
field object. You can do it with tables too but they must be preceded by
an underscore to avoid naming conflicts with fields:

.. code:: python

   db.table._extra = {}

Legacy databases and keyed tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

py4web can connect to legacy databases under some conditions.

The easiest way is when these conditions are met:

- Each table must have a unique auto-increment integer field called “id”.
- Records must be referenced exclusively using the “id” field.

When accessing an existing table, i.e., a table not created by py4web in
the current application, always set ``migrate=False``.

If the legacy table has an auto-increment integer field but it is not
called “id”, py4web can still access it but the table definition must
declare the auto-increment field with ‘id’ type (that is using
``FIeld('...', 'id')``).

Finally if the legacy table uses a primary key that is not an
auto-increment id field it is possible to use a “keyed table”, for
example:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('account',
                   Field('accnum', 'integer'),
                   Field('acctype'),
                   Field('accdesc'),
                   primarykey=['accnum', 'acctype'],
                   migrate=False)

-  ``primarykey`` is a list of the field names that make up the primary
   key.
-  All primarykey fields have a ``NOT NULL`` set even if not specified.
-  Keyed tables can only reference other keyed tables.
-  Referencing fields must use the ``reference tablename.fieldname``
   format.
-  The ``update_record`` function is not available for Rows of keyed
   tables.

..

   Currently keyed tables are only supported for DB2, MSSQL, Ingres and
   Informix, but others engines will be added.

At the time of writing, we cannot guarantee that the ``primarykey``
attribute works with every existing legacy table and every supported
database backend. For simplicity, we recommend, if possible, creating a
database view that has an auto-increment id field.


Field constructor
-----------------

These are the default values of a Field constructor:

.. code:: python

   Field(fieldname, type='string', length=None, default=DEFAULT,
         required=False, requires=DEFAULT,
         ondelete='CASCADE', notnull=False, unique=False,
         uploadfield=True, widget=None, label=None, comment=None,
         writable=True, readable=True, searchable=True, listable=True,
         update=None, authorize=None, autodelete=False, represent=None,
         uploadfolder=None, uploadseparate=None, uploadfs=None,
         compute=None, filter_in=None, filter_out=None,
         custom_qualifier=None, map_none=None, rname=None)

where DEFAULT is a special value used to allow the value None for a
parameter.

Not all of them are relevant for every field. ``length`` is relevant
only for fields of type “string”. ``uploadfield``, ``authorize``, and
``autodelete`` are relevant only for fields of type “upload”.
``ondelete`` is relevant only for fields of type “reference” and
“upload”.

-  ``length`` sets the maximum length of a “string”, “password” or
   “upload” field. If ``length`` is not specified a default value is
   used but the default value is not guaranteed to be backward
   compatible. *To avoid unwanted migrations on upgrades, we recommend
   that you always specify the length for string, password and upload
   fields.*
-  ``default`` sets the default value for the field. The default value
   is used when performing an insert if a value is not explicitly
   specified. It is also used to pre-populate forms built from the table
   using ``Form``. Note, rather than being a fixed value, the default
   can instead be a function (including a lambda function) that returns
   a value of the appropriate type for the field. In that case, the
   function is called once for each record inserted, even when multiple
   records are inserted in a single transaction.
-  ``required`` tells the DAL that no insert should be allowed on this
   table if a value for this field is not explicitly specified.
-  ``requires`` is a **validator** or a list of validators. This is not used
   by the DAL, but instead it is used by ``Form`` (this will be explained
   better on the :ref:`Forms` chapter). The default validators for
   the given types are shown in the next section
   :ref:`Field types and validators`.

   .. note::

      while ``requires=...`` is enforced at the level of forms,
      ``required=True`` is enforced at the level of the DAL (insert). In
      addition, ``notnull``, ``unique`` and ``ondelete`` are enforced at
      the level of the database. While they sometimes may seem redundant,
      it is important to maintain the distinction when programming with the
      DAL.

-  ``rname`` provides the field with a “real name”, a name for the field
   known to the database adapter; when the field is used, it is the
   rname value which is sent to the database. The py4web name for the
   field is then effectively an alias.

-  ``ondelete`` translates into the “ON DELETE” SQL statement. By
   default it is set to “CASCADE”. This tells the database that when it
   deletes a record, it should also delete all records that refer to it.
   To disable this feature, set ``ondelete`` to “NO ACTION” or “SET
   NULL”.

-  ``notnull=True`` translates into the “NOT NULL” SQL statement. It
   prevents the database from inserting null values for the field.

-  ``unique=True`` translates into the “UNIQUE” SQL statement and it
   makes sure that values of this field are unique within the table. It
   is enforced at the database level.

-  ``uploadfield`` applies only to fields of type “upload”. A field of
   type “upload” stores the name of a file saved somewhere else, by
   default on the filesystem under the application “uploads/” folder. If
   ``uploadfield`` is set to True, then the file is stored in a blob
   field within the same table and the value of ``uploadfield`` is the
   name of the blob field. This will be discussed in more detail later
   in `More on uploads`_.
-  ``uploadfolder`` must be set to a location where to store uploaded files.
   The scaffolding app defines a folder ``settings.UPLOAD_FOLDER``
   which points to ``apps/{app_name}/uploads`` so you can
   set, for example, ``Field(... uploadfolder=settings.UPLOAD_FOLDER)``.
-  ``uploadseparate`` if set to True will upload files under different
   subfolders of the *uploadfolder* folder. This is optimized to avoid
   too many files under the same folder/subfolder. ATTENTION: You cannot
   change the value of ``uploadseparate`` from True to False without
   breaking links to existing uploads. pydal either uses the separate
   subfolders or it does not. Changing the behavior after files have
   been uploaded will prevent pydal from being able to retrieve those
   files. If this happens it is possible to move files and fix the
   problem but this is not described here.
-  ``uploadfs`` allows you specify a different file system where to
   upload files, including an Amazon S3 storage or a remote SFTP
   storage.

..

   You need to have PyFileSystem installed for this to work.
   ``uploadfs`` must point to PyFileSystem.

-  ``autodelete`` determines if the corresponding uploaded file should
   be deleted when the record referencing the file is deleted. For
   “upload” fields only. However, records deleted by the database itself
   due to a CASCADE operation will not trigger py4web’s autodelete.

-  ``label`` is a string (or a helper or something that can be
   serialized to a string) that contains the label to be used for this
   field in auto-generated forms.
   serialized to a string) that contains a comment associated with this
   field, and will be displayed to the right of the input field in the
   autogenerated forms.
-  ``writable`` declares whether a field is writable in forms.
-  ``readable`` declares whether a field is readable in forms. If a
   field is neither readable nor writable, it will not be displayed in
   create and update forms.
-  ``update`` contains the default value for this field when the record
   is updated.
-  ``compute`` is an optional function. If a record is inserted or
   updated, the compute function will be executed and the field will be
   populated with the function result. The record is passed to the
   compute function as a ``dict``, and the dict will not include the
   current value of that, or any other compute field.
-  ``authorize`` can be used to require access control on the
   corresponding field, for “upload” fields only. It will be discussed
   more in detail in the context of Authentication and Authorization.
-  ``represent`` can be None or can point to a function that takes a
   field value and returns an alternate representation for the field
   value. Examples:

Note not all the attributes are thread safe and most of them
should only be set globally for an app. The following are guaranteed to be
thread safe and be set/reset in any action:
``default``, ``update``, ``readable``, ``writable``, ``requires``.

==========================  ==================================================
Type                        Default validators
==========================  ==================================================
``string``                  ``IS_LENGTH(length)`` default length is 512
``text``                    ``IS_LENGTH(length)`` default length is 32768

``upload``                  ``None`` default length is 512
``reference <table>``       ``IS_IN_DB(db, table.field, format)``
``list:string``             ``None``
``list:integer``            ``None``
``list:reference <table>``  ``IS_IN_DB(db, table._id, format, multiple=True)``
``json``                    ``IS_EMPTY_OR(IS_JSON())`` default length is 512
``bigint``                  ``IS_INT_IN_RANGE(-2**63, 2**63)``
``big-id``                  ``None``
``big-reference``           ``None``
==========================  ==================================================

Decimal requires and returns values as ``Decimal`` objects, as defined
in the Python ``decimal`` module. SQLite does not handle the ``decimal``
type so internally we treat it as a ``double``. The (n,m) are the number
of digits in total and the number of digits after the decimal point
respectively.

The ``big-id`` and, ``big-reference`` are only supported by some of the
database engines and are experimental. They are not normally used as
field types unless for legacy tables, however, the DAL constructor has a
``bigint_id`` argument that when set to ``True`` makes the ``id`` fields
and ``reference`` fields ``big-id`` and ``big-reference`` respectively.

The ``list:<type>`` fields are special because they are designed to take
advantage of certain denormalization features on NoSQL (in the case of
Google App Engine NoSQL, the field types ``ListProperty`` and
``StringListProperty``) and back-port them all the other supported
relational databases. On relational databases lists are stored as a
``text`` field. The items are separated by a ``|`` and each ``|`` in
string item is escaped as a ``||``. They are discussed in
:ref:`list_type and contains`.

The ``json`` field type is pretty much explanatory. It can store any
JSON serializable object. It is designed to work specifically for
MongoDB and backported to the other database adapters for portability.

``blob`` fields are also special. By default, binary data is encoded in
base64 before being stored into the actual database field, and it is
decoded when extracted. This has the negative effect of using 33% more
storage space than necessary in blob fields, but has the advantage of
making the communication independent of the back-end specific escaping
conventions.

Run-time field and table modification
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Most attributes of fields and tables can be modified after they are
defined:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('person', Field('name', default=''), format='%(name)s')
   <Table person (id, name)>
   >>> db.person._format = '%(name)s/%(id)s'
   >>> db.person.name.default = 'anonymous'

notice that attributes of tables are usually prefixed by an underscore
to avoid conflict with possible field names.

You can list the tables that have been defined for a given database
connection:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.tables
   ['person']

You can query for the type of a table:

.. code:: python

   >>> type(db.person)
   <class 'pydal.objects.Table'>

You can access a table using different syntaxes:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.person is db['person']
   True

You can also list the fields that have been defined for a given table:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.person.fields
   ['id', 'name']

Similarly you can access fields from their name in multiple equivalent
ways:

.. code:: python

   >>> type(db.person.name)
   <class 'pydal.objects.Field'>
   >>> db.person.name is db.person['name']
   True

Given a field, you can access the attributes set in its definition:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.person.name.type
   string
   >>> db.person.name.unique
   False
   >>> db.person.name.notnull
   False
   >>> db.person.name.length
   32

including its parent table, tablename, and parent connection:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.person.name._table == db.person
   True
   >>> db.person.name._tablename == 'person'
   True
   >>> db.person.name._db == db
   True

A field also has methods. Some of them are used to build queries and we
will see them later. A special method of the field object is
``validate`` and it calls the validators for the field.

.. code:: python

   >>> db.person.name.validate('John')
   ('John', None)

which returns a tuple ``(value, error)``. ``error`` is ``None`` if the
input passes validation.

More on uploads
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. FIXME: review needed

Consider the following model:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('myfile',
                   Field('image', 'upload', default='path/to/file'))

In the case of an “upload” field, the default value can optionally be
set to a path (an absolute path or a path relative to the current app
folder), the default value is then assigned to each new record that does
not specify an image.

Notice that this way multiple records may end to reference the same
default image file and this could be a problem on a Field having
``autodelete`` enabled. When you do not want to allow duplicates for the
image field (i.e. multiple records referencing the same file) but still
want to set a default value for the “upload” then you need a way to copy
the default file for each new record that does not specify an image.
This can be obtained using a file-like object referencing the default
file as the ``default`` argument to Field, or even with:

.. code:: python

   Field('image', 'upload', default=dict(data='<file_content>', filename='<file_name>'))

Normally an insert is handled automatically via a ``Form`` but
occasionally you already have the file on the filesystem and want to
upload it programmatically. This can be done in this way:

.. code:: python

   with open(filename, 'rb') as stream:
       db.myfile.insert(image=db.myfile.image.store(stream, filename))

It is also possible to insert a file in a simpler way and have the
insert method call ``store`` automatically:

.. code:: python

   with open(filename, 'rb') as stream:
       db.myfile.insert(image=stream)

In this case the filename is obtained from the stream object if
available.

The ``store`` method of the upload field object takes a file stream and
a filename. It uses the filename to determine the extension (type) of
the file, creates a new temp name for the file (according to py4web
upload mechanism) and loads the file content in this new temp file
(under the uploads folder unless specified otherwise). It returns the
new temp name, which is then stored in the ``image`` field of the
``db.myfile`` table.

Note, if the file is to be stored in an associated blob field rather
than the file system, the ``store`` method will not insert the file in
the blob field (because ``store`` is called before the insert), so the
file must be explicitly inserted into the blob field:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('myfile',
                   Field('image', 'upload', uploadfield='image_file'),
                   Field('image_file', 'blob'))
   with open(filename, 'rb') as stream:
       db.myfile.insert(image=db.myfile.image.store(stream, filename),
                        image_file=stream.read())

The ``retrieve`` method does the opposite of ``store``.

When uploaded files are stored on filesystem (as in the case of a plain
``Field('image', 'upload')``) the code:

.. code:: python

   row = db(db.myfile).select().first()
   (filename, fullname) = db.myfile.image.retrieve(row.image, nameonly=True)

retrieves the original file name (filename) as seen by the user at
upload time and the name of stored file (fullname, with path relative to
application folder). While in general the call:

.. code:: python

   (filename, stream) = db.myfile.image.retrieve(row.image)

retrieves the original file name (filename) and a file-like object ready
to access uploaded file data (stream).

   Notice that the stream returned by ``retrieve`` is a real file object
   in the case that uploaded files are stored on filesystem. In that
   case remember to close the file when you are done, calling
   ``stream.close()``.

Here is an example of safe usage of ``retrieve``:

.. code:: python

   from contextlib import closing
   import shutil
   row = db(db.myfile).select().first()
   (filename, stream) = db.myfile.image.retrieve(row.image)
   with closing(stream) as src, closing(open(filename, 'wb')) as dest:
       shutil.copyfileobj(src, dest)


Migrations
----------

With our example table definition:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person')

``define_table`` checks whether or not the corresponding table exists.
If it does not, it generates the SQL to create it and executes the SQL.
If the table does exist but differs from the one being defined, it
generates the SQL to alter the table and executes it. If a field has
changed type but not name, it will try to convert the data (If you do
not want this, you need to redefine the table twice, the first time,
letting py4web drop the field by removing it, and the second time adding
the newly defined field so that py4web can create it). If the table
exists and matches the current definition, it will leave it alone. In
all cases it will create the ``db.person`` object that represents the
table.

We refer to this behavior as a “migration”. py4web logs all migrations
and migration attempts in the file “sql.log”.

.. note::

   by default py4web uses the “app/databases” folder for the
   log file and all other migration files it needs. You can change this
   setting by changing the ``folder`` argument to DAL. To set a different
   log file name, for example “migrate.log” you can do
   ``db = DAL(..., adapter_args=dict(logfile='migrate.log'))``

The first argument of ``define_table`` is always the table name. The
other unnamed arguments are the fields. The function also takes
an optional keyword argument called “migrate”:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person', ..., migrate='person.table')

The value of migrate is the filename where py4web stores internal
migration information for this table. These files are very important and
should never be removed while the corresponding tables exist. In cases
where a table has been dropped and the corresponding file still exist,
it can be removed manually. By default, migrate is set to True. This
causes py4web to generate the filename from a hash of the connection
string. If migrate is set to False, the migration is not performed, and
py4web assumes that the table exists in the datastore and it contains
(at least) the fields listed in ``define_table``.

There may not be two tables in the same application with the same
migrate filename.

The DAL class also takes a “migrate” argument, which determines the
default value of migrate for calls to ``define_table``. For example,

.. code:: python

   db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite', migrate=False)

will set the default value of migrate to False whenever
``db.define_table`` is called without a migrate argument.

.. note::

   py4web only migrates new columns, removed columns, and
   changes in column type (except in SQLite). py4web does not migrate
   changes in attributes such as changes in the values of ``default``,
   ``unique``, ``notnull``, and ``ondelete``.

Migrations can be disabled for all tables at once:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL(..., migrate_enabled=False)

This is the recommended behavior when two apps share the same database.
Only one of the two apps should perform migrations, the other should
disable them.

Fixing broken migrations
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are two common problems with migrations and there are ways to
recover from them.

One problem is specific with SQLite. SQLite does not enforce column
types and cannot drop columns. This means that if you have a column of
type string and you remove it, it is not really removed. If you add the
column again with a different type (for example datetime) you end up
with a datetime column that contains strings (junk for practical
purposes). py4web does not complain about this because it does not know
what is in the database, until it tries to retrieve records and fails.

If py4web returns an error in some parse function when selecting
records, most likely this is due to corrupted data in a column because
of the above issue.

The solution consists in updating all records of the table and updating
the values in the column in question with None.

The other problem is more generic but typical with MySQL. MySQL does not
allow more than one ALTER TABLE in a transaction. This means that py4web
must break complex transactions into smaller ones (one ALTER TABLE at
the time) and commit one piece at the time. It is therefore possible
that part of a complex transaction gets committed and one part fails,
leaving py4web in a corrupted state. Why would part of a transaction
fail? Because, for example, it involves altering a table and converting
a string column into a datetime column, py4web tries to convert the
data, but the data cannot be converted. What happens to py4web? It gets
confused about what exactly is the table structure actually stored in
the database.

The solution consists of enabling fake migrations:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table(...., migrate=True, fake_migrate=True)

This will rebuild py4web metadata about the table according to the table
definition. Try multiple table definitions to see which one works (the
one before the failed migration and the one after the failed migration).
Once successful remove the ``fake_migrate=True`` parameter.

Before attempting to fix migration problems it is prudent to make a copy
of “yourapp/databases/\*.table” files.

Migration problems can also be fixed for all tables at once:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL(..., fake_migrate_all=True)

This also fails if the model describes tables that do not exist in the
database, but it can help narrowing down the problem.

Migration control summary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The logic of the various migration arguments are summarized in this
pseudo-code:

.. code:: python

   if DAL.migrate_enabled and table.migrate:
      if DAL.fake_migrate_all or table.fake_migrate:
          perform fake migration
      else:
          perform migration


Table methods
-------------

``insert``
~~~~~~~~~~

Given a table, you can insert records

.. code:: python

   >>> db.person.insert(name="Alex")
   1
   >>> db.person.insert(name="Bob")
   2

Insert returns the unique “id” value of each record inserted.

You can truncate the table, i.e., delete all records and reset the
counter of the id.

.. code:: python

   >>> db.person.truncate()

Now, if you insert a record again, the counter starts again at 1 (this
is back-end specific and does not apply to Google NoSQL):

.. code:: python

   >>> db.person.insert(name="Alex")
   1

Notice you can pass a parameter to ``truncate``, for example you can
tell SQLite to restart the id counter.

.. code:: python

   >>> db.person.truncate('RESTART IDENTITY CASCADE')

The argument is in raw SQL and therefore engine specific.

py4web also provides a bulk_insert method

.. code:: python

   >>> db.person.bulk_insert([{'name': 'Alex'}, {'name': 'John'}, {'name': 'Tim'}])
   [3, 4, 5]

It takes a list of dictionaries of fields to be inserted and performs
multiple inserts at once. It returns the list of “id” values of the
inserted records. On the supported relational databases there is no
advantage in using this function as opposed to looping and performing
individual inserts but on Google App Engine NoSQL, there is a major
speed advantage.

``Query``, ``Set``, ``Rows``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Let’s consider again the table defined (and dropped) previously and
insert three records:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('person', Field('name'))
   <Table person (id, name)>
   >>> db.person.insert(name="Alex")
   1
   >>> db.person.insert(name="Bob")
   2
   >>> db.person.insert(name="Carl")
   3

You can store the table in a variable. For example, with variable
``person``, you could do:

.. code:: python

   >>> person = db.person

You can also store a field in a variable such as ``name``. For example,
you could also do:

.. code:: python

   >>> name = person.name

You can even build a query (using operators like ==, !=, <, >, <=, >=,
like, belongs) and store the query in a variable ``q`` such as in:

.. code:: python

   >>> q = name == 'Alex'

When you call ``db`` with a query, you define a set of records. You can
store it in a variable ``s`` and write:

.. code:: python

   >>> s = db(q)

Notice that no database query has been performed so far. DAL + Query
simply define a set of records in this db that match the query. py4web
determines from the query which table (or tables) are involved and, in
fact, there is no need to specify that.

``update_or_insert``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some times you need to perform an insert only if there is no record with
the same values as those being inserted. This can be done with

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person',
                   Field('name'),
                   Field('birthplace'))

   db.person.update_or_insert(name='John', birthplace='Chicago')

The record will be inserted only if there is no other user called John
born in Chicago.

You can specify which values to use as a key to determine if the record
exists. For example:

.. code:: python

   db.person.update_or_insert(db.person.name == 'John',
                              name='John',
                              birthplace='Chicago')

and if there is John his birthplace will be updated else a new record
will be created.

The selection criteria in the example above is a single field. It can
also be a query, such as

.. code:: python

   db.person.update_or_insert((db.person.name == 'John') & (db.person.birthplace == 'Chicago'),
                              name='John',
                              birthplace='Chicago',
                              pet='Rover')

``validate_and_insert``, ``validate_and_update``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The function

.. code:: python

   ret = db.mytable.validate_and_insert(field='value')

works very much like

.. code:: python

   id = db.mytable.insert(field='value')

except that it calls the validators for the fields before performing the
insert and bails out if the validation does not pass. If validation does
not pass the errors can be found in ``ret.errors``. ``ret.errors`` holds
a key-value mapping where each key is the field name whose validation
failed, and the value of the key is the result from the validation error
(much like ``form.errors``). If it passes, the id of the new record is
in ``ret.id``. Mind that normally validation is done by the form
processing logic so this function is rarely needed.

Similarly

.. code:: python

   ret = db(query).validate_and_update(field='value')

works very much the same as

.. code:: python

   num = db(query).update(field='value')

except that it calls the validators for the fields before performing the
update. Notice that it only works if query involves a single table. The
number of updated records can be found in ``ret.updated`` and errors
will be in ``ret.errors``.

``drop``
~~~~~~~~

Finally, you can drop tables and all data will be lost:

.. code:: python

   db.person.drop()

Tagging records
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Tags allows to add or find properties attached to records in your
database.

.. code:: python

   from py4web import DAL, Field
   from pydal.tools.tags import Tags

   db = DAL("sqlite:memory")
   db.define_table("thing", Field("name"))
   properties = Tags(db.thing)
   id1 = db.thing.insert(name="chair")
   id2 = db.thing.insert(name="table")
   properties.add(id1, "color/red")
   properties.add(id1, "style/modern")
   properties.add(id2, "color/green")
   properties.add(id2, "material/wood")

   assert properties.get(id1) == ["color/red", "style/modern"]
   assert properties.get(id2) == ["color/green", "material/wood"]

   rows = db(properties.find(["style/modern"])).select()
   assert rows.first().id == id1

   rows = db(properties.find(["material/wood"])).select()
   assert rows.first().id == id2

   rows = db(properties.find(["color"])).select()
   assert len(rows) == 2

It is internally implemented as a table, which in
this example would be db.thing_tags_default, because no tail was
specified on the Tags(table, tail=“default”) constructor.

The ``find`` method is doing a search by ``startswith`` of the
parameter. Then find([“color”]) would return id1 and id2
because both records have tags starting with “color”. py4web uses tags as a
flexible mechanism to manage permissions.


Raw SQL
-------

``executesql``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DAL allows you to explicitly issue SQL statements.

.. code:: python

   >>> db.executesql('SELECT * FROM person;')
   [(1, u'Massimo'), (2, u'Massimo')]

In this case, the return values are not parsed or transformed by the
DAL, and the format depends on the specific database driver. This usage
with selects is normally not needed, but it is more common with indexes.

``executesql`` takes five optional arguments: ``placeholders``,
``as_dict``, ``fields``, ``colnames``, and ``as_ordered_dict``.

``placeholders`` is an optional sequence of values to be substituted in
or, if supported by the DB driver, a dictionary with keys matching named
placeholders in your SQL.

If ``as_dict`` is set to True, the results cursor returned by the DB
driver will be converted to a sequence of dictionaries keyed with the db
field names. Results returned with ``as_dict = True`` are the same as
those returned when applying as_list() to a normal select:

.. code:: python

   [{'field1': val1_row1, 'field2': val2_row1}, {'field1': val1_row2, 'field2': val2_row2}]

``as_ordered_dict`` is pretty much like ``as_dict`` but the former
ensures that the order of resulting fields (OrderedDict keys) reflect
the order on which they are returned from DB driver:

.. code:: python

   [OrderedDict([('field1', val1_row1), ('field2', val2_row1)]),
    OrderedDict([('field1', val1_row2), ('field2', val2_row2)])]

The ``fields`` argument is a list of DAL Field objects that match the
fields returned from the DB. The Field objects should be part of one or
more Table objects defined on the DAL object. The ``fields`` list can
include one or more DAL Table objects in addition to or instead of
including Field objects, or it can be just a single table (not in a
list). In that case, the Field objects will be extracted from the
table(s).

Instead of specifying the ``fields`` argument, the ``colnames`` argument
can be specified as a list of field names in tablename.fieldname format.
Again, these should represent tables and fields defined on the DAL
object.

It is also possible to specify both ``fields`` and the associated
``colnames``. In that case, ``fields`` can also include DAL Expression
objects in addition to Field objects. For Field objects in “fields”, the
associated ``colnames`` must still be in tablename.fieldname format. For
Expression objects in ``fields``, the associated ``colnames`` can be any
arbitrary labels.

Notice, the DAL Table objects referred to by ``fields`` or ``colnames``
can be dummy tables and do not have to represent any real tables in the
database. Also, note that the ``fields`` and ``colnames`` must be in the
same order as the fields in the results cursor returned from the DB.

``_lastsql``
~~~~~~~~~~~~

Whether SQL was executed manually using executesql or was SQL generated
by the DAL, you can always find the SQL code in ``db._lastsql``. This is
useful for debugging purposes:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = db().select(db.person.ALL)
   >>> db._lastsql
   SELECT person.id, person.name FROM person;

..

   py4web never generates queries using the “*” operator. py4web is
   always explicit when selecting fields.

Timing queries
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

All queries are automatically timed by py4web. The variable
``db._timings`` is a list of tuples. Each tuple contains the raw SQL
query as passed to the database driver and the time it took to execute
in seconds.

Indexes
~~~~~~~

Currently the DAL API does not provide a command to create indexes on
tables, but this can be done using the ``executesql`` command. This is
because the existence of indexes can make migrations complex, and it is
better to deal with them explicitly. Indexes may be needed for those
fields that are used in recurrent queries.

Here is an example of how to:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite')
   db.define_table('person', Field('name'))
   db.executesql('CREATE INDEX IF NOT EXISTS myidx ON person (name);')

Other database dialects have very similar syntaxes but may not support
the optional “IF NOT EXISTS” directive.

Generating raw SQL
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Sometimes you need to generate the SQL but not execute it. This is easy
to do with py4web since every command that performs database IO has an
equivalent command that does not, and simply returns the SQL that would
have been executed. These commands have the same names and syntax as the
functional ones, but they start with an underscore:

Here is ``_insert``

.. code:: python

   >>> print(db.person._insert(name='Alex'))
   INSERT INTO "person"("name") VALUES ('Alex');

Here is ``_count``

.. code:: python

   >>> print(db(db.person.name == 'Alex')._count())
   SELECT COUNT(*) FROM "person" WHERE ("person"."name" = 'Alex');

Here is ``_select``

.. code:: python

   >>> print(db(db.person.name == 'Alex')._select())
   SELECT "person"."id", "person"."name" FROM "person" WHERE ("person"."name" = 'Alex');

Here is ``_delete``

.. code:: python

   >>> print(db(db.person.name == 'Alex')._delete())
   DELETE FROM "person" WHERE ("person"."name" = 'Alex');

And finally, here is ``_update``

.. code:: python

   >>> print(db(db.person.name == 'Alex')._update(name='Susan'))
   UPDATE "person" SET "name"='Susan' WHERE ("person"."name" = 'Alex');

..

   Moreover you can always use ``db._lastsql`` to return the most recent
   SQL code, whether it was executed manually using executesql or was
   SQL generated by the DAL.


``select`` command
------------------

Given a Set, ``s``, you can fetch the records with the command
``select``:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = s.select()

It returns an iterable object of class ``pydal.objects.Rows`` whose
elements are Row objects. ``pydal.objects.Row`` objects act like
dictionaries, but their elements can also be accessed as attributes.
The former differ from the latter because
its values are read-only.

The Rows object allows looping over the result of the select and
printing the selected field values for each row:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in rows:
   ...     print(row.id, row.name)
   ...
   1 Alex

You can do all the steps in one statement:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db(db.person.name == 'Alex').select():
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Alex

The select command can take arguments. All unnamed arguments are
interpreted as the names of the fields that you want to fetch. For
example, you can be explicit on fetching field “id” and field “name”:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db().select(db.person.id, db.person.name):
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Alex
   Bob
   Carl

The table attribute ALL allows you to specify all fields:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db().select(db.person.ALL):
   ...     print(row.id, row.name)
   ...
   1 Alex
   2 Bob
   3 Carl

Notice that there is no query string passed to db. py4web understands
that if you want all fields of the table person without additional
information then you want all records of the table person.

An equivalent alternative syntax is the following:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db(db.person).select():
   ...     print(row.id, row.name)
   ...
   1 Alex
   2 Bob
   3 Carl

and py4web understands that if you ask for all records of the table
person without additional information, then you want all the fields of
table person.

Given one row

.. code:: python

   >>> row = rows[0]

you can extract its values using multiple equivalent expressions:

.. code:: python

   >>> row.name
   Alex
   >>> row['name']
   Alex
   >>> row('person.name')
   Alex

The latter syntax is particularly handy when selecting an expression
instead of a column. We will show this later.

You can also do

.. code:: python

   rows.compact = False

to disable the notation

.. code:: python

   rows[i].name

and enable, instead, the less compact notation:

.. code:: python

   rows[i].person.name

Yes this is unusual and rarely needed.

Row objects also have two important methods:

.. code:: python

   row.delete_record()

and

.. code:: python

   row.update_record(name="new value")

Using an iterator-based select for lower memory use
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Python “iterators” are a type of “lazy-evaluation”. They ‘feed’ data one
step at time; traditional Python loops create the entire set of data in
memory before looping.

The traditional use of select is:

.. code:: python

   for row in db(db.table).select():
       ...

but for large numbers of rows, using an iterator-based alternative has
dramatically lower memory use:

.. code:: python

   for row in db(db.table).iterselect():
       ...

Testing shows this is around 10% faster as well, even on machines with
large RAM.

Rendering rows using represent
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You may wish to rewrite rows returned by select to take advantage of
formatting information contained in the represents setting of the
fields.

.. code:: python

   rows = db(query).select()
   repr_row = rows.render(0)

If you don’t specify an index, you get a generator to iterate over all
the rows:

.. code:: python

   for row in rows.render():
       print(row.myfield)

Can also be applied to slices:

.. code:: python

   for row in rows[0:10].render():
       print(row.myfield)

If you only want to transform selected fields via their “represent”
attribute, you can list them in the “fields” argument:

.. code:: python

   repr_row = row.render(0, fields=[db.mytable.myfield])

Note, it returns a transformed copy of the original Row, so there’s no
update_record (which you wouldn't want anyway) or delete_record.

Shortcuts
~~~~~~~~~

The DAL supports various code-simplifying shortcuts. In particular:

.. code:: python

   myrecord = db.mytable[id]

returns the record with the given ``id`` if it exists. If the ``id``
does not exist, it returns ``None``. The above statement is equivalent
to

.. code:: python

   myrecord = db(db.mytable.id == id).select().first()

You can delete records by id:

.. code:: python

   del db.mytable[id]

and this is equivalent to

.. code:: python

   db(db.mytable.id == id).delete()

and deletes the record with the given ``id``, if it exists.

Note: this delete shortcut syntax does not currently work if
*versioning* is activated

You can insert records:

.. code:: python

   db.mytable[None] = dict(myfield='somevalue')

It is equivalent to

.. code:: python

   db.mytable.insert(myfield='somevalue')

and it creates a new record with field values specified by the
dictionary on the right hand side.

Note: insert shortcut was previously ``db.table[0] = ...``. It has
changed in pyDAL 19.02 to permit normal usage of id 0.

.. FIXME: maybe this is happened before py4web born,
   so do we still need this note?

You can update records:

.. code:: python

   db.mytable[id] = dict(myfield='somevalue')

which is equivalent to

.. code:: python

   db(db.mytable.id == id).update(myfield='somevalue')

and it updates an existing record with field values specified by the
dictionary on the right hand side.

Fetching a ``Row``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Yet another convenient syntax is the following:

.. code:: python

   record = db.mytable(id)
   record = db.mytable(db.mytable.id == id)
   record = db.mytable(id, myfield='somevalue')

Apparently similar to ``db.mytable[id]`` the above syntax is more
flexible and safer. First of all it checks whether ``id`` is an int (or
``str(id)`` is an int) and returns ``None`` if not (it never raises an
exception). It also allows to specify multiple conditions that the
record must meet. If they are not met, it also returns ``None``.

Recursive ``select``\ s
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the previous table person and a new table “thing” referencing a
“person”:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('thing',
                   Field('name'),
                   Field('owner_id', 'reference person'))

and a simple select from this table:

.. code:: python

   things = db(db.thing).select()

which is equivalent to

.. code:: python

   things = db(db.thing._id != None).select()

where ``_id`` is a reference to the primary key of the table. Normally
``db.thing._id`` is the same as ``db.thing.id`` and we will assume that
in most of this book.

For each Row of things it is possible to fetch not just fields from the
selected table (thing) but also from linked tables (recursively):

.. code:: python

   for thing in things:
       print(thing.name, thing.owner_id.name)

Here ``thing.owner_id.name`` requires one database select for each thing
in things and it is therefore inefficient. We suggest using joins
whenever possible instead of recursive selects, nevertheless this is
convenient and practical when accessing individual records.

You can also do it backwards, by selecting the things referenced by a
person:

.. code:: python

   person = db.person(id)
   for thing in person.thing.select(orderby=db.thing.name):
       print(person.name, 'owns', thing.name)

In this last expression ``person.thing`` is a shortcut for

.. code:: python

   db(db.thing.owner_id == person.id)

i.e. the Set of ``thing``\ s referenced by the current ``person``. This
syntax breaks down if the referencing table has multiple references to
the referenced table. In this case one needs to be more explicit and use
a full Query.

.. _orderby, groupby, limitby:

``orderby``, ``groupby``, ``limitby``, ``distinct``, ``having``, ``orderby_on_limitby``, ``join``, ``left``, ``cache``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``select`` command takes a number of optional arguments.

orderby
^^^^^^^

You can fetch the records sorted by name:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db().select(db.person.ALL, orderby=db.person.name):
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Alex
   Bob
   Carl

You can fetch the records sorted by name in reverse order (notice the
tilde):

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db().select(db.person.ALL, orderby=~db.person.name):
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Carl
   Bob
   Alex

You can have the fetched records appear in random order:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db().select(db.person.ALL, orderby='<random>'):
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Carl
   Alex
   Bob

..

   The use of ``orderby='<random>'`` is not supported on Google NoSQL.
   However, to overcome this limit, sorting can be accomplished on
   selected rows:

.. code:: python

   import random
   rows = db(...).select().sort(lambda row: random.random())

You can sort the records according to multiple fields by concatenating
them with a “\|”:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db().select(db.person.name, orderby=db.person.name|db.person.id):
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Alex
   Bob
   Carl

groupby, having
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Using ``groupby`` together with ``orderby``, you can group records with
the same value for the specified field (this is back-end specific, and
is not on the Google NoSQL):

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db().select(db.person.ALL,
   ...                        orderby=db.person.name,
   ...                        groupby=db.person.name):
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Alex
   Bob
   Carl

You can use ``having`` in conjunction with ``groupby`` to group
conditionally (only those ``having`` the condition are grouped).

.. code:: python

   db(query1).select(db.person.ALL, groupby=db.person.name, having=query2)

Notice that query1 filters records to be displayed, query2 filters
records to be grouped.

distinct
^^^^^^^^

With the argument ``distinct=True``, you can specify that you only want
to select distinct records. This has the same effect as grouping using
all specified fields except that it does not require sorting. When using
distinct it is important not to select ALL fields, and in particular not
to select the “id” field, else all records will always be distinct.

Here is an example:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db().select(db.person.name, distinct=True):
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Alex
   Bob
   Carl

Notice that ``distinct`` can also be an expression, for example:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db().select(db.person.name, distinct=db.person.name):
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Alex
   Bob
   Carl

limitby
^^^^^^^

With ``limitby=(min, max)``, you can select a subset of the records from
offset=min to but not including offset=max. In the next example we
select the first two records starting at zero:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db().select(db.person.ALL, limitby=(0, 2)):
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Alex
   Bob

orderby_on_limitby
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Note that the DAL defaults to implicitly adding an orderby when using a
limitby. This ensures the same query returns the same results each time,
important for pagination. But it can cause performance problems. use
``orderby_on_limitby = False`` to change this (this defaults to True).

join, left
^^^^^^^^^^

These are involved in managing `One to many relation`_. They are
described in `Inner join`_ and `Left outer join`_ sections respectively.

cache, cacheable
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

An example use which gives much faster selects is:

.. code:: python

   rows = db(query).select(cache=(cache.ram, 3600), cacheable=True)

Look at `Caching selects`_, to understand what the trade-offs are.

Logical operators
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Queries can be combined using the binary AND operator “``&``”:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = db((db.person.name=='Alex') & (db.person.id > 3)).select()
   >>> for row in rows: print row.id, row.name
   >>> len(rows)
   0

and the binary OR operator “``|``”:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = db((db.person.name == 'Alex') | (db.person.id > 3)).select()
   >>> for row in rows: print row.id, row.name
   1 Alex

You can negate a sub-query inverting its operator:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = db((db.person.name != 'Alex') | (db.person.id > 3)).select()
   >>> for row in rows: print row.id, row.name
   2 Bob
   3 Carl

or by explicit negation with the “``~``” unary operator:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = db(~(db.person.name == 'Alex') | (db.person.id > 3)).select()
   >>> for row in rows: print row.id, row.name
   2 Bob
   3 Carl

..

   Due to Python restrictions in overloading “``and``” and “``or``”
   operators, these cannot be used in forming queries. The binary
   operators “``&``” and “``|``” must be used instead. Note that these
   operators (unlike “``and``” and “``or``”) have higher precedence than
   comparison operators, so the “extra” parentheses in the above
   examples are mandatory. Similarly, the unary operator “``~``” has
   higher precedence than comparison operators, so ``~``-negated
   comparisons must also be parenthesized.

It is also possible to build queries using in-place logical operators:

.. code:: python

   >>> query = db.person.name != 'Alex'
   >>> query &= db.person.id > 3
   >>> query |= db.person.name == 'John'

``count``, ``isempty``, ``delete``, ``update``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

You can count records in a set:

.. code:: python

   >>> db(db.person.name != 'William').count()
   3

Notice that ``count`` takes an optional ``distinct`` argument which
defaults to False, and it works very much like the same argument for
``select``. ``count`` has also a ``cache`` argument that works very much
like the equivalent argument of the ``select`` method.

Sometimes you may need to check if a table is empty. A more efficient
way than counting is using the ``isempty`` method:

.. code:: python

   >>> db(db.person).isempty()
   False

You can delete records in a set:

.. code:: python

   >>> db(db.person.id > 3).delete()
   0

The ``delete`` method returns the number of records that were deleted.

And you can update all records in a set by passing named arguments
corresponding to the fields that need to be updated:

.. code:: python

   >>> db(db.person.id > 2).update(name='Ken')
   1

The ``update`` method returns the number of records that were updated.

Expressions
~~~~~~~~~~~

The value assigned an update statement can be an expression. For example
consider this model

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person',
                   Field('name'),
                   Field('visits', 'integer', default=0))

   db(db.person.name == 'Massimo').update(visits = db.person.visits + 1)

The values used in queries can also be expressions

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person',
                   Field('name'),
                   Field('visits', 'integer', default=0),
                   Field('clicks', 'integer', default=0))

   db(db.person.visits == db.person.clicks + 1).delete()

``case``
~~~~~~~~

An expression can contain a case clause for example:

.. code:: python

   >>> condition = db.person.name.startswith('B')
   >>> yes_or_no = condition.case('Yes', 'No')
   >>> for row in db().select(db.person.name, yes_or_no):
   ...     print(row.person.name, row[yes_or_no])  # could be row(yes_or_no) too
   ...
   Alex No
   Bob Yes
   Ken No

``update_record``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

py4web also allows updating a single record that is already in memory
using ``update_record``

.. code:: python

   >>> row = db(db.person.id == 2).select().first()
   >>> row.update_record(name='Curt')
   <Row {'id': 2, 'name': 'Curt'}>

``update_record`` should not be confused with

.. code:: python

   >>> row.update(name='Curt')

because for a single row, the method ``update`` updates the row object
but not the database record, as in the case of ``update_record``.

It is also possible to change the attributes of a row (one at a time)
and then call ``update_record()`` without arguments to save the changes:

.. code:: python

   >>> row = db(db.person.id > 2).select().first()
   >>> row.name = 'Philip'
   >>> row.update_record() # saves above change
   <Row {'id': 3, 'name': 'Philip'}>

..

   Note, you should avoid using ``row.update_record()`` with no
   arguments when the ``row`` object contains fields that have an
   ``update`` attribute (e.g.,
   ``Field('modified_on', update=datetime.datetime.utcnow)``). Calling
   ``row.update_record()`` will retain *all* of the existing values in
   the ``row`` object, so any fields with ``update`` attributes will
   have no effect in this case. Be particularly mindful of this with
   tables that include ``auth.signature``.

The ``update_record`` method is available only if the table’s ``id``
field is included in the select, and ``cacheable`` is not set to
``True``.

Inserting and updating from a dictionary
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common issue consists of needing to insert or update records in a
table where the name of the table, the field to be updated, and the
value for the field are all stored in variables. For example:
``tablename``, ``fieldname``, and ``value``.

The insert can be done using the following syntax:

.. code:: python

   db[tablename].insert(**{fieldname:value})

The update of record with given id can be done with:

.. code:: python

   db(db[tablename]._id == id).update(**{fieldname:value})

Notice we used ``table._id`` instead of ``table.id``. In this way the
query works even for tables with a primary key field with type other
than “id”.

``first`` and ``last``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Given a Rows object containing records:

.. code:: python

   rows = db(query).select()
   first_row = rows.first()
   last_row = rows.last()

are equivalent to

.. code:: python

   first_row = rows[0] if len(rows) else None
   last_row = rows[-1] if len(rows) else None

Notice, ``first()`` and ``last()`` allow you to obtain obviously the
first and last record present in your query, but this won’t mean that
these records are going to be the first or last inserted records. In
case you want the first or last record inputted in a given table don’t
forget to use ``orderby=db.table_name.id``. If you forget you will only
get the first and last record returned by your query which are often in
a random order determined by the backend query optimiser.

``as_dict`` and ``as_list``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A Row object can be serialized into a regular dictionary using the
``as_dict()`` method and a Rows object can be serialized into a list of
dictionaries using the ``as_list()`` method. Here are some examples:

.. code:: python

   rows = db(query).select()
   rows_list = rows.as_list()
   first_row_dict = rows.first().as_dict()

These methods are convenient for passing Rows to generic views and or to
store Rows in sessions (Rows objects themselves cannot be
serialized because they contain a reference to an open DB connection):

.. code:: python

   rows = db(query).select()
   session.rows = rows  # not allowed!
   session.rows = rows.as_list()  # allowed!

Combining rows
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rows objects can be combined at the Python level. Here we assume:

.. code:: python

   >>> print(rows1)
   person.name
   Max
   Tim

   >>> print(rows2)
   person.name
   John
   Tim

You can do union of the records in two sets of rows:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows3 = rows1 + rows2
   >>> print(rows3)
   person.name
   Max
   Tim
   John
   Tim

You can do union of the records removing duplicates:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows3 = rows1 | rows2
   >>> print(rows3)
   person.name
   Max
   Tim
   John

You can do intersection of the records in two sets of rows:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows3 = rows1 & rows2
   >>> print(rows3)
   person.name
   Tim

``find``, ``exclude``, ``sort``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Some times you need to perform two selects and one contains a subset of
a previous select. In this case it is pointless to access the database
again. The ``find``, ``exclude`` and ``sort`` objects allow you to
manipulate a Rows object and generate another one without accessing the
database. More specifically: - ``find`` returns a new set of Rows
filtered by a condition and leaves the original unchanged. - ``exclude``
returns a new set of Rows filtered by a condition and removes them from
the original Rows. - ``sort`` returns a new set of Rows sorted by a
condition and leaves the original unchanged.

All these methods take a single argument, a function that acts on each
individual row.

Here is an example of usage:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('person', Field('name'))
   <Table person (id, name)>
   >>> db.person.insert(name='John')
   1
   >>> db.person.insert(name='Max')
   2
   >>> db.person.insert(name='Alex')
   3
   >>> rows = db(db.person).select()
   >>> for row in rows.find(lambda row: row.name[0]=='M'):
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Max
   >>> len(rows)
   3
   >>> for row in rows.exclude(lambda row: row.name[0]=='M'):
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Max
   >>> len(rows)
   2
   >>> for row in rows.sort(lambda row: row.name):
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Alex
   John

They can be combined:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = db(db.person).select()
   >>> rows = rows.find(lambda row: 'x' in row.name).sort(lambda row: row.name)
   >>> for row in rows:
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Alex
   Max

Sort takes an optional argument ``reverse=True`` with the obvious
meaning.

The ``find`` method has an optional ``limitby`` argument with the same
syntax and functionality as the Set ``select`` method.

Caching selects
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The select method also takes a ``cache`` argument, which defaults to
None. For caching purposes, it should be set to a tuple where the first
element is the cache model (``cache.ram``, ``cache.disk``, etc.), and
the second element is the expiration time in seconds.

In the following example, you see a controller that caches a select on
the previously defined db.log table. The actual select fetches data from
the back-end database no more frequently than once every 60 seconds and
stores the result in memory. If the next call to this controller occurs
in less than 60 seconds since the last database IO, it simply fetches
the previous data from memory.

.. code:: python

   def cache_db_select():
       logs = db().select(db.log.ALL, cache=(cache.ram, 60))
       return dict(logs=logs)

The ``select`` method has an optional ``cacheable`` argument, normally
set to False. When ``cacheable=True`` the resulting ``Rows`` is
serializable but The ``Row``\ s lack ``update_record`` and
``delete_record`` methods.

If you do not need these methods you can speed up selects a lot by
setting the ``cacheable`` attribute:

.. code:: python

   rows = db(query).select(cacheable=True)

When the ``cache`` argument is set but ``cacheable=False`` (default)
only the database results are cached, not the actual Rows object. When
the ``cache`` argument is used in conjunction with ``cacheable=True``
the entire Rows object is cached and this results in much faster
caching:

.. code:: python

   rows = db(query).select(cache=(cache.ram, 3600), cacheable=True)


Computed and Virtual fields
---------------------------

Computed fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

DAL fields may have a ``compute`` attribute. This must be a function (or
lambda) that takes a Row object and returns a value for the field. When
a new record is modified, including both insertions and updates, if a
value for the field is not provided, py4web tries to compute from the
other field values using the ``compute`` function. Here is an example:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('item',
   ...                 Field('unit_price', 'double'),
   ...                 Field('quantity', 'integer'),
   ...                 Field('total_price',
   ...                       compute=lambda r: r['unit_price'] * r['quantity']))
   <Table item (id, unit_price, quantity, total_price)>
   >>> rid = db.item.insert(unit_price=1.99, quantity=5)
   >>> db.item[rid]
   <Row {'total_price': '9.95', 'unit_price': 1.99, 'id': 1L, 'quantity': 5}>

Notice that the computed value is stored in the db and it is not
computed on retrieval, as in the case of virtual fields, described next.
Two typical applications of computed fields are:

- in wiki applications, to store the processed input wiki text as HTML, to
  avoid re-processing on every request
- for searching, to compute normalized values for a field, to be used for searching.

Computed fields are evaluated in the order in which they are defined in
the table definition. A computed field can refer to previously defined
computed fields.

Virtual fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Virtual fields are also computed fields (as in the previous subsection)
but they differ from those because they are *virtual* in the sense that
they are not stored in the db and they are computed each time records
are extracted from the database. They can be used to simplify the user’s
code without using additional storage but they cannot be used for
searching.

New style virtual fields (experimental)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

py4web provides a new and easier way to define virtual fields and lazy
virtual fields. This section is marked experimental because the APIs may
still change a little from what is described here.

Here we will consider the same example as in the previous subsection. In
particular we consider the following model:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('item',
                   Field('unit_price', 'double'),
                   Field('quantity', 'integer'))

One can define a ``total_price`` virtual field as

.. code:: python

   db.item.total_price = Field.Virtual(lambda row: row.item.unit_price * row.item.quantity)

i.e. by simply defining a new field ``total_price`` to be a
``Field.Virtual``. The only argument of the constructor is a function
that takes a row and returns the computed values.

A virtual field defined as the one above is automatically computed for
all records when the records are selected:

.. code:: python

   for row in db(db.item).select():
       print(row.total_price)

It is also possible to define method fields which are calculated
on-demand, when called. For example:

.. code:: python

   db.item.discounted_total = \
       Field.Method(lambda row, discount=0.0:
                    row.item.unit_price * row.item.quantity * (100.0 - discount / 100))

In this case ``row.discounted_total`` is not a value but a function. The
function takes the same arguments as the function passed to the
``Method`` constructor except for ``row`` which is implicit (think of it
as ``self`` for objects).

The lazy field in the example above allows one to compute the total
price for each ``item``:

.. code:: python

   for row in db(db.item).select(): print(row.discounted_total())

And it also allows to pass an optional ``discount`` percentage (say
15%):

.. code:: python

   for row in db(db.item).select(): print(row.discounted_total(15))

Virtual and Method fields can also be defined in place when a table is
defined:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('item',
                   Field('unit_price', 'double'),
                   Field('quantity', 'integer'),
                   Field.Virtual('total_price', lambda row: ...),
                   Field.Method('discounted_total', lambda row, discount=0.0: ...))

..

   Mind that virtual fields do not have the same attributes as regular
   fields (length, default, required, etc). They do not appear in the
   list of ``db.table.fields``.

Old style virtual fields
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In order to define one or more virtual fields, you can also define a
container class, instantiate it and link it to a table or to a select.
For example, consider the following table:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('item',
                   Field('unit_price', 'double'),
                   Field('quantity', 'integer'))

One can define a ``total_price`` virtual field as

.. code:: python

   class MyVirtualFields:
       def total_price(self):
           return self.item.unit_price * self.item.quantity

   db.item.virtualfields.append(MyVirtualFields())

Notice that each method of the class that takes a single argument (self)
is a new virtual field. ``self`` refers to each one row of the select.
Field values are referred by full path as in ``self.item.unit_price``.
The table is linked to the virtual fields by appending an instance of
the class to the table’s ``virtualfields`` attribute.

Virtual fields can also access recursive fields as in

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('item',
                   Field('unit_price', 'double'))

   db.define_table('order_item',
                   Field('item', 'reference item'),
                   Field('quantity', 'integer'))

   class MyVirtualFields:
       def total_price(self):
           return self.order_item.item.unit_price * self.order_item.quantity

   db.order_item.virtualfields.append(MyVirtualFields())

Notice the recursive field access ``self.order_item.item.unit_price``
where ``self`` is the looping record.

They can also act on the result of a JOIN

.. code:: python

   rows = db(db.order_item.item == db.item.id).select()

   class MyVirtualFields:
       def total_price(self):
           return self.item.unit_price * self.order_item.quantity

   rows.setvirtualfields(order_item=MyVirtualFields())

   for row in rows:
       print(row.order_item.total_price)

Notice how in this case the syntax is different. The virtual field
accesses both ``self.item.unit_price`` and ``self.order_item.quantity``
which belong to the join select. The virtual field is attached to the
rows of the table using the ``setvirtualfields`` method of the rows
object. This method takes an arbitrary number of named arguments and can
be used to set multiple virtual fields, defined in multiple classes, and
attach them to multiple tables:

.. code:: python

   class MyVirtualFields1:
       def discounted_unit_price(self):
           return self.item.unit_price * 0.90

   class MyVirtualFields2:
       def total_price(self):
           return self.item.unit_price * self.order_item.quantity
       def discounted_total_price(self):
           return self.item.discounted_unit_price * self.order_item.quantity

   rows.setvirtualfields(item=MyVirtualFields1(),
                         order_item=MyVirtualFields2())

   for row in rows:
       print(row.order_item.discounted_total_price)

Virtual fields can be *lazy*; all they need to do is return a function
and access it by calling the function:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('item',
                   Field('unit_price', 'double'),
                   Field('quantity', 'integer'))

   class MyVirtualFields:
       def lazy_total_price(self):
           def lazy(self=self):
               return self.item.unit_price * self.item.quantity
           return lazy

   db.item.virtualfields.append(MyVirtualFields())

   for item in db(db.item).select():
       print(item.lazy_total_price())

or shorter using a lambda function:

.. code:: python

   class MyVirtualFields:
       def lazy_total_price(self):
           return lambda self=self: self.item.unit_price * self.item.quantity


Joins and Relations
-------------------

One to many relation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

To illustrate how to implement one to many relations with the DAL,
define another table “thing” that refers to the table “person” which we
redefine here:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('person',
   ...                 Field('name'))
   <Table person (id, name)>
   >>> db.person.insert(name='Alex')
   1
   >>> db.person.insert(name='Bob')
   2
   >>> db.person.insert(name='Carl')
   3
   >>> db.define_table('thing',
   ...                 Field('name'),
   ...                 Field('owner_id', 'reference person'))
   <Table thing (id, name, owner_id)>

Table “thing” has two fields, the name of the thing and the owner of the
thing. The “owner_id” field is a reference field, it is intended that
the field reference the other table by its id. A reference type can be
specified in two equivalent ways, either:
``Field('owner_id', 'reference person')`` or:
``Field('owner_id', db.person)``.

The latter is always converted to the former. They are equivalent except
in the case of lazy tables, self references or other types of cyclic
references where the former notation is the only allowed notation.

Now, insert three things, two owned by Alex and one by Bob:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.thing.insert(name='Boat', owner_id=1)
   1
   >>> db.thing.insert(name='Chair', owner_id=1)
   2
   >>> db.thing.insert(name='Shoes', owner_id=2)
   3

You can select as you did for any other table:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db(db.thing.owner_id == 1).select():
   ...     print(row.name)
   ...
   Boat
   Chair

Because a thing has a reference to a person, a person can have many
things, so a record of table person now acquires a new attribute thing,
which is a Set, that defines the things of that person. This allows
looping over all persons and fetching their things easily:

.. code:: python

   >>> for person in db().select(db.person.ALL):
   ...     print(person.name)
   ...     for thing in person.thing.select():
   ...         print('    ', thing.name)
   ...
   Alex
        Boat
        Chair
   Bob
        Shoes
   Carl

Inner join
~~~~~~~~~~

Another way to achieve a similar result is by using a join, specifically
an INNER JOIN. py4web performs joins automatically and transparently
when the query links two or more tables as in the following example:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = db(db.person.id == db.thing.owner_id).select()
   >>> for row in rows:
   ...     print(row.person.name, 'has', row.thing.name)
   ...
   Alex has Boat
   Alex has Chair
   Bob has Shoes

Observe that py4web did a join, so the rows now contain two records, one
from each table, linked together. Because the two records may have
fields with conflicting names, you need to specify the table when
extracting a field value from a row. This means that while before you
could do:

.. code:: python

   row.name

and it was obvious whether this was the name of a person or a thing, in
the result of a join you have to be more explicit and say:

.. code:: python

   row.person.name

or:

.. code:: python

   row.thing.name

There is an alternative syntax for INNER JOINS:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = db(db.person).select(join=db.thing.on(db.person.id == db.thing.owner_id))
   >>> for row in rows:
   ...     print(row.person.name, 'has', row.thing.name)
   ...
   Alex has Boat
   Alex has Chair
   Bob has Shoes

While the output is the same, the generated SQL in the two cases can be
different. The latter syntax removes possible ambiguities when the same
table is joined twice and aliased:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('thing',
                   Field('name'),
                   Field('owner_id1', 'reference person'),
                   Field('owner_id2', 'reference person'))

   rows = db(db.person).select(
           join=[db.person.with_alias('owner_id1').on(db.person.id == db.thing.owner_id1),
                 db.person.with_alias('owner_id2').on(db.person.id == db.thing.owner_id2)])

The value of ``join`` can be list of ``db.table.on(...)`` to join.

Left outer join
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Notice that Carl did not appear in the list above because he has no
things. If you intend to select on persons (whether they have things or
not) and their things (if they have any), then you need to perform a
LEFT OUTER JOIN. This is done using the argument “left” of the select.
Here is an example:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = db().select(db.person.ALL, db.thing.ALL,
   ...                    left=db.thing.on(db.person.id == db.thing.owner_id))
   >>> for row in rows:
   ...     print(row.person.name, 'has', row.thing.name)
   ...
   Alex has Boat
   Alex has Chair
   Bob has Shoes
   Carl has None

where:

.. code:: python

   left = db.thing.on(...)

does the left join query. Here the argument of ``db.thing.on`` is the
condition required for the join (the same used above for the inner
join). In the case of a left join, it is necessary to be explicit about
which fields to select.

Multiple left joins can be combined by passing a list or tuple of
``db.mytable.on(...)`` to the ``left`` parameter.

Grouping and counting
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When doing joins, sometimes you want to group rows according to certain
criteria and count them. For example, count the number of things owned
by every person. py4web allows this as well. First, you need a count
operator. Second, you want to join the person table with the thing table
by owner. Third, you want to select all rows (person + thing), group
them by person, and count them while grouping:

.. code:: python

   >>> count = db.person.id.count()
   >>> for row in db(db.person.id == db.thing.owner_id
   ...               ).select(db.person.name, count, groupby=db.person.name):
   ...     print(row.person.name, row[count])
   ...
   Alex 2
   Bob 1

Notice the ``count`` operator (which is built-in) is used as a field.
The only issue here is in how to retrieve the information. Each row
clearly contains a person and the count, but the count is not a field of
a person nor is it a table. So where does it go? It goes into the
storage object representing the record with a key equal to the query
expression itself.

The ``count`` method of the Field object has an optional ``distinct``
argument. When set to ``True`` it specifies that only distinct values of
the field in question are to be counted.

Many to many relation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In the previous examples, we allowed a thing to have one owner but one
person could have many things. What if Boat was owned by Alex and Curt?
This requires a many-to-many relation, and it is realized via an
intermediate table that links a person to a thing via an ownership
relation.

Here is how to do it:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('person',
   ...                 Field('name'))
   <Table person (id, name)>
   >>> db.person.bulk_insert([dict(name='Alex'), dict(name='Bob'), dict(name='Carl')])
   [1, 2, 3]
   >>> db.define_table('thing',
   ...                 Field('name'))
   <Table thing (id, name)>
   >>> db.thing.bulk_insert([dict(name='Boat'), dict(name='Chair'), dict(name='Shoes')])
   [1, 2, 3]
   >>> db.define_table('ownership',
   ...                 Field('person', 'reference person'),
   ...                 Field('thing', 'reference thing'))
   <Table ownership (id, person, thing)>

the existing ownership relationship can now be rewritten as:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.ownership.insert(person=1, thing=1)  # Alex owns Boat
   1
   >>> db.ownership.insert(person=1, thing=2)  # Alex owns Chair
   2
   >>> db.ownership.insert(person=2, thing=3)  # Bob owns Shoes
   3

Now you can add the new relation that Curt co-owns Boat:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.ownership.insert(person=3, thing=1)  # Curt owns Boat too
   4

Because you now have a three-way relation between tables, it may be
convenient to define a new set on which to perform operations:

.. code:: python

   >>> persons_and_things = db((db.person.id == db.ownership.person) &
   ...                         (db.thing.id == db.ownership.thing))

Now it is easy to select all persons and their things from the new Set:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in persons_and_things.select():
   ...     print(row.person.name, 'has', row.thing.name)
   ...
   Alex has Boat
   Alex has Chair
   Bob has Shoes
   Curt has Boat

Similarly, you can search for all things owned by Alex:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in persons_and_things(db.person.name == 'Alex').select():
   ...     print(row.thing.name)
   ...
   Boat
   Chair

and all owners of Boat:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in persons_and_things(db.thing.name == 'Boat').select():
   ...     print(row.person.name)
   ...
   Alex
   Curt

A lighter alternative to many-to-many relations is tagging, you can
found an example of this in the next section. Tagging works even on
database backends that do not support JOINs like the Google App Engine
NoSQL.

Self-Reference and aliases
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to define tables with fields that refer to themselves,
here is an example:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person',
                   Field('name'),
                   Field('father_id', 'reference person'),
                   Field('mother_id', 'reference person'))

Notice that the alternative notation of using a table object as field
type will fail in this case, because it uses a table before it is
defined:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person',
                   Field('name'),
                   Field('father_id', db.person),  # wrong!
                   Field('mother_id', db['person']))  # wrong!

In general ``db.tablename`` and ``'reference tablename'`` are equivalent
field types, but the latter is the only one allowed for self-references.

When a table has a self-reference and you have to do join, for example
to select a person and its father, you need an alias for the table. In
SQL an alias is a temporary alternate name you can use to reference a
table/column into a query (or other SQL statement).

With py4web you can make an alias for a table using the ``with_alias``
method. This works also for expressions, which means also for fields
since ``Field`` is derived from ``Expression``.

Here is an example:

.. code:: python

   >>> fid, mid = db.person.bulk_insert([dict(name='Massimo'), dict(name='Claudia')])
   >>> db.person.insert(name='Marco', father_id=fid, mother_id=mid)
   3
   >>> Father = db.person.with_alias('father')
   >>> Mother = db.person.with_alias('mother')
   >>> type(Father)
   <class 'pydal.objects.Table'>
   >>> str(Father)
   'person AS father'
   >>> rows = db().select(db.person.name, Father.name, Mother.name,
   ...                    left=(Father.on(Father.id == db.person.father_id),
   ...                          Mother.on(Mother.id == db.person.mother_id)))
   >>> for row in rows:
   ...     print(row.person.name, row.father.name, row.mother.name)
   ...
   Massimo None None
   Claudia None None
   Marco Massimo Claudia

Notice that we have chosen to make a distinction between: - “father_id”:
the field name used in the table “person”; - “father”: the alias we want
to use for the table referenced by the above field; this is communicated
to the database; - “Father”: the variable used by py4web to refer to
that alias.

The difference is subtle, and there is nothing wrong in using the same
name for the three of them:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('person',
   ...                 Field('name'),
   ...                 Field('father', 'reference person'),
   ...                 Field('mother', 'reference person'))
   <Table person (id, name, father, mother)>
   >>> fid, mid = db.person.bulk_insert([dict(name='Massimo'), dict(name='Claudia')])
   >>> db.person.insert(name='Marco', father=fid, mother=mid)
   3
   >>> father = db.person.with_alias('father')
   >>> mother = db.person.with_alias('mother')
   >>> rows = db().select(db.person.name, father.name, mother.name,
   ...                    left=(father.on(father.id==db.person.father),
   ...                          mother.on(mother.id==db.person.mother)))
   >>> for row in rows:
   ...     print(row.person.name, row.father.name, row.mother.name)
   ...
   Massimo None None
   Claudia None None
   Marco Massimo Claudia

But it is important to have the distinction clear in order to build
correct queries.


Other operators
---------------

py4web has other operators that provide an API to access equivalent SQL
operators. Let’s define another table “log” to store security events,
their event_time and severity, where the severity is an integer number.

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('log', Field('event'),
   ...                        Field('event_time', 'datetime'),
   ...                        Field('severity', 'integer'))
   <Table log (id, event, event_time, severity)>

As before, insert a few events, a “port scan”, an “xss injection” and an
“unauthorized login”. For the sake of the example, you can log events
with the same event_time but with different severities (1, 2, and 3
respectively).

.. code:: python

   >>> import datetime
   >>> now = datetime.datetime.now()
   >>> db.log.insert(event='port scan', event_time=now, severity=1)
   1
   >>> db.log.insert(event='xss injection', event_time=now, severity=2)
   2
   >>> db.log.insert(event='unauthorized login', event_time=now, severity=3)
   3

``like``, ``ilike``, ``regexp``, ``startswith``, ``endswith``, ``contains``, ``upper``, ``lower``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Fields have a ``like`` operator that you can use to match strings:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db(db.log.event.like('port%')).select():
   ...     print(row.event)
   ...
   port scan

Here “port%” indicates a string starting with “port”. The percent sign
character, “%”, is a wild-card character that means “any sequence of
characters”.

The ``like`` operator maps to the LIKE word in ANSI-SQL. LIKE is
case-sensitive in most databases, and depends on the collation of the
database itself. The ``like`` method is hence case-sensitive but it can
be made case-insensitive with

.. code:: python

   db.mytable.myfield.like('value', case_sensitive=False)

which is the same as using ``ilike``

.. code:: python

   db.mytable.myfield.ilike('value')

py4web also provides some shortcuts:

.. code:: python

   db.mytable.myfield.startswith('value')
   db.mytable.myfield.endswith('value')
   db.mytable.myfield.contains('value')

which are roughly equivalent respectively to

.. code:: python

   db.mytable.myfield.like('value%')
   db.mytable.myfield.like('%value')
   db.mytable.myfield.like('%value%')

Remember that ``contains`` has a special meaning for ``list:<type>``
fields, as discussed in :ref:`list_type and contains`.

The ``contains`` method can also be passed a list of values and an
optional boolean argument ``all`` to search for records that contain all
values:

.. code:: python

   db.mytable.myfield.contains(['value1', 'value2'], all=True)

or any value from the list

.. code:: python

   db.mytable.myfield.contains(['value1', 'value2'], all=False)

There is a also a ``regexp`` method that works like the ``like`` method
but allows regular expression syntax for the look-up expression. It is
only supported by MySQL, Oracle, PostgreSQL, SQLite, and MongoDB (with
different degree of support).

The ``upper`` and ``lower`` methods allow you to convert the value of
the field to upper or lower case, and you can also combine them with the
like operator:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db(db.log.event.upper().like('PORT%')).select():
   ...     print(row.event)
   ...
   port scan

``year``, ``month``, ``day``, ``hour``, ``minutes``, ``seconds``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The date and datetime fields have ``day``, ``month`` and ``year``
methods. The datetime and time fields have ``hour``, ``minutes`` and
``seconds`` methods. Here is an example:

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db(db.log.event_time.year() > 2018).select():
   ...     print(row.event)
   ...
   port scan
   xss injection
   unauthorized login

``belongs``
~~~~~~~~~~~

The SQL IN operator is realized via the ``belongs`` method which returns
true when the field value belongs to the specified set (list or tuples):

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db(db.log.severity.belongs((1, 2))).select():
   ...     print(row.event)
   ...
   port scan
   xss injection

The DAL also allows a nested select as the argument of the belongs
operator. The only caveat is that the nested select has to be a
``_select``, not a ``select``, and only one field has to be selected
explicitly, the one that defines the set.

.. code:: python

   >>> bad_days = db(db.log.severity == 3)._select(db.log.event_time)
   >>> for row in db(db.log.event_time.belongs(bad_days)).select():
   ...     print(row.severity, row.event)
   ...
   1 port scan
   2 xss injection
   3 unauthorized login

In those cases where a nested select is required and the look-up field
is a reference we can also use a query as argument. For example:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person', Field('name'))
   db.define_table('thing',
                   Field('name'),
                   Field('owner_id', 'reference person'))

   db(db.thing.owner_id.belongs(db.person.name == 'Jonathan')).select()

In this case it is obvious that the nested select only needs the field
referenced by the ``db.thing.owner_id`` field so we do not need the more
verbose ``_select`` notation.

A nested select can also be used as insert/update value but in this case
the syntax is different:

.. code:: python

   lazy = db(db.person.name == 'Jonathan').nested_select(db.person.id)

   db(db.thing.id == 1).update(owner_id = lazy)

In this case ``lazy`` is a nested expression that computes the ``id`` of
person “Jonathan”. The two lines result in one single SQL query.

``sum``, ``avg``, ``min``, ``max`` and ``len``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Previously, you have used the ``count`` operator to count records.
Similarly, you can use the ``sum`` operator to add (sum) the values of a
specific field from a group of records. As in the case of count, the
result of a sum is retrieved via the storage object:

.. code:: python

   >>> sum = db.log.severity.sum()
   >>> print(db().select(sum).first()[sum])
   6

You can also use ``avg``, ``min``, and ``max`` to the average, minimum,
and maximum value respectively for the selected records. For example:

.. code:: python

   >>> max = db.log.severity.max()
   >>> print(db().select(max).first()[max])
   3

``len`` computes the length of field’s value. It is generally used on
string or text fields but depending on the back-end it may still work
for other types too (boolean, integer, etc).

.. code:: python

   >>> for row in db(db.log.event.len() > 13).select():
   ...     print(row.event)
   ...
   unauthorized login

Expressions can be combined to form more complex expressions. For
example here we are computing the sum of the length of the event strings
in the logs plus one:

.. code:: python

   >>> exp = (db.log.event.len() + 1).sum()
   >>> db().select(exp).first()[exp]
   43

Substrings
~~~~~~~~~~

One can build an expression to refer to a substring. For example, we can
group things whose name starts with the same three characters and select
only one from each group:

.. code:: python

   db(db.thing).select(distinct = db.thing.name[:3])

Default values with ``coalesce`` and ``coalesce_zero``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

There are times when you need to pull a value from database but also
need a default values if the value for a record is set to NULL. In SQL
there is a function, ``COALESCE``, for this. py4web has an equivalent
``coalesce`` method:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('sysuser', Field('username'), Field('fullname'))
   <Table sysuser (id, username, fullname)>
   >>> db.sysuser.insert(username='max', fullname='Max Power')
   1
   >>> db.sysuser.insert(username='tim', fullname=None)
   2
   >>> coa = db.sysuser.fullname.coalesce(db.sysuser.username)
   >>> for row in db().select(coa):
   ...     print(row[coa])
   ...
   Max Power
   tim

Other times you need to compute a mathematical expression but some
fields have a value set to None while it should be zero.
``coalesce_zero`` comes to the rescue by defaulting None to zero in the
query:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('sysuser', Field('username'), Field('points'))
   <Table sysuser (id, username, points)>
   >>> db.sysuser.insert(username='max', points=10)
   1
   >>> db.sysuser.insert(username='tim', points=None)
   2
   >>> exp = db.sysuser.points.coalesce_zero().sum()
   >>> db().select(exp).first()[exp]
   10
   >>> type(exp)
   <class 'pydal.objects.Expression'>
   >>> print(exp)
   SUM(COALESCE("sysuser"."points",'0'))


Exporting and importing data
----------------------------

CSV (one Table at a time)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

When a Rows object is converted to a string it is automatically
serialized in CSV:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = db(db.person.id == db.thing.owner_id).select()
   >>> print(rows)
   person.id,person.name,thing.id,thing.name,thing.owner_id
   1,Alex,1,Boat,1
   1,Alex,2,Chair,1
   2,Bob,3,Shoes,2

You can serialize a single table in CSV and store it in a file
“test.csv”:

.. code:: python

   with open('test.csv', 'wb') as dumpfile:
       dumpfile.write(str(db(db.person).select()))


Converting a ``Rows`` object into a string produces an encoded binary string
and it's better to be explicit with the encoding used:

.. code:: python

   with open('test.csv', 'w', encoding='utf-8', newline='') as dumpfile:
       dumpfile.write(str(db(db.person).select()))

This is equivalent to

.. code:: python

   rows = db(db.person).select()
   with open('test.csv', 'wb') as dumpfile:
       rows.export_to_csv_file(dumpfile)

You can read the CSV file back with:

.. code:: python

   with open('test.csv', 'rb') as dumpfile:
       db.person.import_from_csv_file(dumpfile)

Again, you can be explict about the encoding for
the exporting file:

.. code:: python

   rows = db(db.person).select()
   with open('test.csv', 'w', encoding='utf-8', newline='') as dumpfile:
       rows.export_to_csv_file(dumpfile)

and the importing one:

.. code:: python

   with open('test.csv', 'r', encoding='utf-8', newline='') as dumpfile:
       db.person.import_from_csv_file(dumpfile)

When importing, py4web looks for the field names in the CSV header. In
this example, it finds two columns: “person.id” and “person.name”. It
ignores the “person.” prefix, and it ignores the “id” fields. Then all
records are appended and assigned new ids.

CSV (all tables at once)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

In py4web, you can backup/restore an entire database with two commands:

To export:

.. code:: python

   with open('somefile.csv', 'w', encoding='utf-8', newline='') as dumpfile:
       db.export_to_csv_file(dumpfile)

To import:

.. code:: python

   with open('somefile.csv', 'r', encoding='utf-8', newline='') as dumpfile:
       db.import_from_csv_file(dumpfile)

This mechanism can be used even if the importing database is of a
different type than the exporting database.

The data is stored in “somefile.csv” as a CSV file where each table
starts with one line that indicates the tablename, and another line with
the fieldnames:

::

   TABLE tablename
   field1,field2,field3,...

Two tables are separated by ``\r\n\r\n`` (that is two empty lines). The
file ends with the line

::

   END

The file does not include uploaded files if these are not stored in the
database. The upload files stored on filesystem must be dumped
separately, a zip of the “uploads” folder may suffice in most cases.

When importing, the new records will be appended to the database if it
is not empty. In general the new imported records will not have the same
record id as the original (saved) records but py4web will restore
references so they are not broken, even if the id values may change.

If a table contains a field called ``uuid``, this field will be used to
identify duplicates. Also, if an imported record has the same ``uuid``
as an existing record, the previous record will be updated.

CSV and remote database synchronization
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider once again the following model:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('person',
                   Field('name'))

   db.define_table('thing',
                   Field('name'),
                   Field('owner_id', 'reference person'))

   # usage example
   if db(db.person).isempty():
       nid = db.person.insert(name='Massimo')
       db.thing.insert(name='Chair', owner_id=nid)

Each record is identified by an identifier and referenced by that id. If
you have two copies of the database used by distinct py4web
installations, the id is unique only within each database and not across
the databases. This is a problem when merging records from different
databases.

In order to make records uniquely identifiable across databases, they
must: - have a unique id (UUID), - have a last modification time to
track the most recent among multiple copies, - reference the UUID
instead of the id.

This can be achieved changing the above model into:

.. code:: python

   import datetime
   import uuid

   now = datetime.datetime.utcnow

   db.define_table('person',
                   Field('uuid', length=64),
                   Field('modified_on', 'datetime', default=now, update=now),
                   Field('name'))

   db.define_table('thing',
                   Field('uuid', length=64),
                   Field('modified_on', 'datetime', default=now, update=now),
                   Field('name'),
                   Field('owner_id', length=64))

   db.person.uuid.default = db.thing.uuid.default = lambda:str(uuid.uuid4())

   db.thing.owner_id.requires = IS_IN_DB(db, 'person.uuid', '%(name)s')

   # usage example
   if db(db.person).isempty():
       nid = str(uuid.uuid4())
       db.person.insert(uuid=nid, name='Massimo')
       db.thing.insert(name='Chair', owner_id=nid)

..

   Notice that in the above table definitions, the default value for the
   two ``uuid`` fields is set to a lambda function, which returns a UUID
   (converted to a string). The lambda function is called once for each
   record inserted, ensuring that each record gets a unique UUID, even
   if multiple records are inserted in a single transaction.

Create a controller action to export the database:

.. code:: python

   from py4web import response

   def export():
       s = StringIO.StringIO()
       db.export_to_csv_file(s)
       response.set_header('Content-Type', 'text/csv')
       return s.getvalue()

Create a controller action to import a saved copy of the other database
and sync records:

.. FIXME: from yatl.helpers? review needed on whole next example

.. code:: python

   from yatl.helpers import FORM, INPUT

   def import_and_sync():
       form = FORM(INPUT(_type='file', _name='data'), INPUT(_type='submit'))
       if form.process().accepted:
           db.import_from_csv_file(form.vars.data.file, unique=False)
           # for every table
           for tablename in db.tables:
               table = db[tablename]
               # for every uuid, delete all but the latest
               items = db(table).select(table.id, table.uuid,
                                        orderby=~table.modified_on,
                                        groupby=table.uuid)
               for item in items:
                   db((table.uuid == item.uuid) & (table.id != item.id)).delete()
       return dict(form=form)

Optionally you should create an index manually to make the search by
uuid faster.

Alternatively, you can use XML-RPC to export/import the file.

If the records reference uploaded files, you also need to export/import
the content of the uploads folder. Notice that files therein are already
labeled by UUIDs so you do not need to worry about naming conflicts and
references.

HTML and XML (one Table at a time)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Rows objects also have an ``xml`` method (like helpers) that serializes
it to XML/HTML:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = db(db.person.id == db.thing.owner_id).select()
   >>> print(rows.xml())

.. code:: html

   <table>
   <thead>
   <tr><th>person.id</th><th>person.name</th>
       <th>thing.id</th><th>thing.name</th>
       <th>thing.owner_id</th>
   </tr>
   </thead>
   <tbody>
   <tr class="w2p_odd odd">
       <td>1</td><td>Alex</td>
       <td>1</td><td>Boat</td>
       <td>1</td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="w2p_even even">
       <td>1</td><td>Alex</td>
       <td>2</td><td>Chair</td>
       <td>1</td>
   </tr>
   <tr class="w2p_odd odd">
       <td>2</td><td>Bob</td>
       <td>3</td>
       <td>Shoes</td>
       <td>2</td>
   </tr>
   </tbody>
   </table>

If you need to serialize the Rows in any other XML format with custom
tags, you can easily do that using the universal :ref:`TAG` helper
that we'll see later and the Python syntax
``*<iterable>`` allowed in function calls:

.. code:: python

   >>> rows = db(db.person).select()
   >>> print(TAG.result(*[TAG.row(*[TAG.field(r[f], _name=f) for f in db.person.fields]) for r in rows]))

.. code:: xml

   <result>
   <row><field name="id">1</field><field name="name">Alex</field></row>
   <row><field name="id">2</field><field name="name">Bob</field></row>
   <row><field name="id">3</field><field name="name">Carl</field></row>
   </result>

Data representation
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The ``Rows.export_to_csv_file`` method accepts a keyword argument named
``represent``. When ``True`` it will use the columns ``represent``
function while exporting the data instead of the raw data.

The function also accepts a keyword argument named ``colnames`` that
should contain a list of column names one wish to export. It defaults to
all columns.

Both ``export_to_csv_file`` and ``import_from_csv_file`` accept keyword
arguments that tell the csv parser the format to save/load the files: -
``delimiter``: delimiter to separate values (default ‘,’) -
``quotechar``: character to use to quote string values (default to
double quotes) - ``quoting``: quote system (default
``csv.QUOTE_MINIMAL``)

Here is some example usage:

.. code:: python

   import csv
   rows = db(query).select()
   with open('/tmp/test.txt', 'wb') as oufile:
       rows.export_to_csv_file(oufile,
                               delimiter='|',
                               quotechar='"',
                               quoting=csv.QUOTE_NONNUMERIC)

Which would render something similar to

::

   "hello"|35|"this is the text description"|"2013-03-03"

For more information consult the official Python documentation


Advanced features
-----------------

.. _list_type and contains:

``list:<type>`` and ``contains``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

py4web provides the following special field types:

.. code:: python

   list:string
   list:integer
   list:reference <table>

They can contain lists of strings, of integers and of references
respectively.

On Google App Engine NoSQL ``list:string`` is mapped into
``StringListProperty``, the other two are mapped into
``ListProperty(int)``. On relational databases they are mapped into text
fields which contain the list of items separated by ``|``. For example
``[1, 2, 3]`` is mapped into ``|1|2|3|``.

For lists of string the items are escaped so that any ``|`` in the item
is replaced by a ``||``. Anyway this is an internal representation and
it is transparent to the user.

You can use ``list:string``, for example, in the following way:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('product',
   ...                 Field('name'),
   ...                 Field('colors', 'list:string'))
   <Table product (id, name, colors)>
   >>> db.product.colors.requires = IS_IN_SET(('red', 'blue', 'green'))
   >>> db.product.insert(name='Toy Car', colors=['red', 'green'])
   1
   >>> products = db(db.product.colors.contains('red')).select()
   >>> for item in products:
   ...     print(item.name, item.colors)
   ...
   Toy Car ['red', 'green']

``list:integer`` works in the same way but the items must be integers.

As usual the requirements are enforced at the level of forms, not at the
level of ``insert``.

   For ``list:<type>`` fields the ``contains(value)`` operator maps into
   a non trivial query that checks for lists containing the ``value``.
   The ``contains`` operator also works for regular ``string`` and
   ``text`` fields and it maps into a ``LIKE '%value%'``.

The ``list:reference`` and the ``contains(value)`` operator are
particularly useful to de-normalize many-to-many relations. Here is an
example:

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('tag',
   ...                 Field('name'),
   ...                 format='%(name)s')
   <Table tag (id, name)>
   >>> db.define_table('product',
   ...                 Field('name'),
   ...                 Field('tags', 'list:reference tag'))
   <Table product (id, name, tags)>
   >>> a = db.tag.insert(name='red')
   >>> b = db.tag.insert(name='green')
   >>> c = db.tag.insert(name='blue')
   >>> db.product.insert(name='Toy Car', tags=[a, b, c])
   1
   >>> products = db(db.product.tags.contains(b)).select()
   >>> for item in products:
   ...     print(item.name, item.tags)
   ...
   Toy Car [1, 2, 3]
   >>> for item in products:
   ...     print(item.name, db.product.tags.represent(item.tags))
   ...
   Toy Car red, green, blue

Notice that a ``list:reference tag`` field get a default constraint

.. code:: python

   requires = IS_IN_DB(db, db.tag._id, db.tag._format, multiple=True)

that produces a ``SELECT/OPTION`` multiple drop-box in forms.

Also notice that this field gets a default ``represent`` attribute which
represents the list of references as a comma-separated list of formatted
references. This is used in read ``forms``.

   While ``list:reference`` has a default validator and a default
   representation, ``list:integer`` and ``list:string`` do not. So these
   two need an ``IS_IN_SET`` or an ``IS_IN_DB`` validator if you want to
   use them in forms.


Table inheritance
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to create a table that contains all the fields from
another table. It is sufficient to pass the other table in place of a
field to ``define_table``. For example

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('person', Field('name'), Field('gender'))
   <Table person (id, name, gender)>
   >>> db.define_table('doctor', db.person, Field('specialization'))
   <Table doctor (id, name, gender, specialization)>

It is also possible to define a dummy table that is not stored in a
database in order to reuse it in multiple other places. For example:

.. code:: python

   now = datetime.datetime.utcnow

   signature = db.Table(db, 'signature',
                        Field('is_active', 'boolean', default=True),
                        Field('created_on', 'datetime', default=now),
                        Field('created_by', db.auth_user, default=auth.user_id),
                        Field('modified_on', 'datetime', update=now),
                        Field('modified_by', db.auth_user, update=auth.user_id))

   db.define_table('payment', Field('amount', 'double'), signature)

This example assumes that standard py4web authentication is enabled.

Notice that if you use ``Auth`` py4web already creates one such table
for you:

.. code:: python

   auth = Auth(db)
   db.define_table('payment', Field('amount', 'double'), auth.signature)

When using table inheritance, if you want the inheriting table to
inherit validators, be sure to define the validators of the parent table
before defining the inheriting table.

.. _filter_in and filter_out:

``filter_in`` and ``filter_out``
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to define a filter for each field to be called before a
value is inserted into the database for that field and after a value is
retrieved from the database.

Imagine for example that you want to store a serializable Python data
structure in a field in the JSON format. Here is how it could be
accomplished:

.. code:: python

   >>> import json
   >>> db.define_table('anyobj',
   ...                 Field('name'),
   ...                 Field('data', 'text'))
   <Table anyobj (id, name, data)>
   >>> db.anyobj.data.filter_in = lambda obj: json.dumps(obj)
   >>> db.anyobj.data.filter_out = lambda txt: json.loads(txt)
   >>> myobj = ['hello', 'world', 1, {2: 3}]
   >>> aid = db.anyobj.insert(name='myobjname', data=myobj)
   >>> row = db.anyobj[aid]
   >>> row.data
   ['hello', 'world', 1, {'2': 3}]

Another way to accomplish the same is by using a Field of type
``SQLCustomType``, as discussed in :ref:`Custom Field types`.

callbacks on record insert, delete and update
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

PY4WEB provides a mechanism to register callbacks to be called before
and/or after insert, update and delete of records.

Each table stores six lists of callbacks:

::

   db.mytable._before_insert
   db.mytable._after_insert
   db.mytable._before_update
   db.mytable._after_update
   db.mytable._before_delete
   db.mytable._after_delete

You can register a callback function by appending it to the
corresponding list. The caveat is that depending on the functionality,
the callback has different signature.

This is best explained by examples.

.. code:: python

   >>> db.define_table('person', Field('name'))
   <Table person (id, name)>
   >>> def pprint(callback, *args):
   ...     print("%s%s" % (callback, args))
   ...
   >>> db.person._before_insert.append(lambda f: pprint('before_insert', f))
   >>> db.person._after_insert.append(lambda f, i: pprint('after_insert', f, i))
   >>> db.person.insert(name='John')
   before_insert(<OpRow {'name': 'John'}>,)
   after_insert(<OpRow {'name': 'John'}>, 1)
   1
   >>> db.person._before_update.append(lambda s, f: pprint('before_update', s, f))
   >>> db.person._after_update.append(lambda s, f: pprint('after_update', s, f))
   >>> db(db.person.id == 1).update(name='Tim')
   before_update(<Set ("person"."id" = 1)>, <OpRow {'name': 'Tim'}>)
   after_update(<Set ("person"."id" = 1)>, <OpRow {'name': 'Tim'}>)
   1
   >>> db.person._before_delete.append(lambda s: pprint('before_delete', s))
   >>> db.person._after_delete.append(lambda s: pprint('after_delete', s))
   >>> db(db.person.id == 1).delete()
   before_delete(<Set ("person"."id" = 1)>,)
   after_delete(<Set ("person"."id" = 1)>,)
   1

As you can see: - ``f`` gets passed the ``OpRow`` object with data for
insert or update. - ``i`` gets passed the id of the newly inserted
record. - ``s`` gets passed the ``Set`` object used for update or
delete. ``OpRow`` is an helper object specialized in storing (field,
value) pairs, you can think of it as a normal dictionary that you can
use even with the syntax of attribute notation (that is ``f.name`` and
``f['name']`` are equivalent).

The return values of these callback should be ``None`` or ``False``. If
any of the ``_before_*`` callback returns a ``True`` value it will abort
the actual insert/update/delete operation.

Some times a callback may need to perform an update in the same or a
different table and one wants to avoid firing other callbacks, which
could cause an infinite loop.

For this purpose there the ``Set`` objects have an ``update_naive``
method that works like ``update`` but ignores before and after
callbacks.

Database cascades
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

Database schema can define relationships which trigger deletions of
related records, known as cascading. The DAL is not informed when a
record is deleted due to a cascade. So no \*_delete callback will ever
be called as consequence of a cascade-deletion.

Record versioning
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

It is possible to ask py4web to save every copy of a record when the
record is individually modified. There are different ways to do it and
it can be done for all tables at once using the syntax:

.. code:: python

   auth.enable_record_versioning(db)

this requires ``Auth``. It can also be done for each individual table as
discussed below.

Consider the following table:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('stored_item',
                   Field('name'),
                   Field('quantity', 'integer'),
                   Field('is_active', 'boolean',
                         writable=False, readable=False, default=True))

Notice the hidden boolean field called ``is_active`` and defaulting to
True.

We can tell py4web to create a new table (in the same or a different
database) and store all previous versions of each record in the table,
when modified.

This is done in the following way:

.. code:: python

   db.stored_item._enable_record_versioning()

or in a more verbose syntax:

.. code:: python

   db.stored_item._enable_record_versioning(archive_db=db,
                                            archive_name='stored_item_archive',
                                            current_record='current_record',
                                            is_active='is_active')

The ``archive_db=db`` tells py4web to store the archive table in the
same database as the ``stored_item`` table. The ``archive_name`` sets
the name for the archive table. The archive table has the same fields as
the original table ``stored_item`` except that unique fields are no
longer unique (because it needs to store multiple versions) and has an
extra field which name is specified by ``current_record`` and which is a
reference to the current record in the ``stored_item`` table.

When records are deleted, they are not really deleted. A deleted record
is copied in the ``stored_item_archive`` table (like when it is
modified) and the ``is_active`` field is set to False. By enabling
record versioning py4web sets a ``common_filter`` on this table that
hides all records in table ``stored_item`` where the ``is_active`` field
is set to False. The ``is_active`` parameter in the
``_enable_record_versioning`` method allows to specify the name of the
field used by the ``common_filter`` to determine if the field was
deleted or not.

Common filters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

A common filter is a generalization of the above multi-tenancy idea. It
provides an easy way to prevent repeating of the same query. Consider
for example the following table:

.. code:: python

   db.define_table('blog_post',
                   Field('subject'),
                   Field('post_text', 'text'),
                   Field('is_public', 'boolean'),
                   common_filter = lambda query: db.blog_post.is_public == True)

Any select, delete or update in this table, will include only public
blog posts. The attribute can also be modified at runtime:

.. code:: python

   db.blog_post._common_filter = lambda query: ...

It serves both as a way to avoid repeating the
“db.blog_post.is_public==True” phrase in each blog post search, and also
as a security enhancement, that prevents you from forgetting to disallow
viewing of non-public posts.

In case you actually do want items left out by the common filter (for
example, allowing the admin to see non-public posts), you can either
remove the filter:

.. code:: python

   db.blog_post._common_filter = None

or ignore it:

.. code:: python

   db(query, ignore_common_filters=True)

..

   Note that common_filters are ignored by the appadmin interface.

.. _Custom Field types:
   
Custom ``Field`` types
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Aside for using ``filter_in`` and ``filter_out``, it is possible to
define new/custom field types. For example, suppose that you want to
define a custom type to store an IP address:

.. code:: python

   >>> def ip2int(sv):
   ...     "Convert an IPV4 to an integer."
   ...     sp = sv.split('.'); assert len(sp) == 4 # IPV4 only
   ...     iip = 0
   ...     for i in map(int, sp): iip = (iip<<8) + i
   ...     return iip
   ...
   >>> def int2ip(iv):
   ...     "Convert an integer to an IPV4."
   ...     assert iv > 0
   ...     iv = (iv,); ov = []
   ...     for i in range(3):
   ...         iv = divmod(iv[0], 256)
   ...         ov.insert(0, iv[1])
   ...     ov.insert(0, iv[0])
   ...     return '.'.join(map(str, ov))
   ...
   >>> from pydal import SQLCustomType
   >>> ipv4 = SQLCustomType(type='string', native='integer',
   ...                      encoder=lambda x : str(ip2int(x)), decoder=int2ip)
   >>> db.define_table('website',
   ...                 Field('name'),
   ...                 Field('ipaddr', type=ipv4))
   <Table website (id, name, ipaddr)>
   >>> db.website.insert(name='wikipedia', ipaddr='91.198.174.192')
   1
   >>> db.website.insert(name='google', ipaddr='172.217.11.174')
   2
   >>> db.website.insert(name='youtube', ipaddr='74.125.65.91')
   3
   >>> db.website.insert(name='github', ipaddr='207.97.227.239')
   4
   >>> rows = db(db.website.ipaddr > '100.0.0.0').select(orderby=~db.website.ipaddr)
   >>> for row in rows:
   ...     print(row.name, row.ipaddr)
   ...
   github 207.97.227.239
   google 172.217.11.174

``SQLCustomType`` is a field type factory. Its ``type`` argument must be
one of the standard py4web types. It tells py4web how to treat the field
values at the py4web level. ``native`` is the type of the field as far
as the database is concerned. Allowed names depend on the database
engine. ``encoder`` is an optional transformation function applied when
the data is stored and ``decoder`` is the optional reverse
transformation function.

   This feature is marked as experimental because can make your code not
   portable across database engines.

It does not work on Google App Engine NoSQL.

Using DAL without define tables
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

The DAL can be used from any Python program simply by doing this:

.. code:: python

   from pydal import DAL, Field
   db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite', folder='path/to/app/databases')

i.e. import the DAL, connect and specify the folder which contains the
.table files (the app/databases folder).

To access the data and its attributes we still have to define all the
tables we are going to access with ``db.define_table``.

If we just need access to the data but not to the py4web table
attributes, we get away without re-defining the tables but simply asking
py4web to read the necessary info from the metadata in the .table files:

.. code:: python

   from py4web import DAL, Field
   db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite', folder='path/to/app/databases', auto_import=True)

This allows us to access any db.table without need to re-define it.

Distributed transaction
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

   At the time of writing this feature is only supported by PostgreSQL,
   MySQL and Firebird, since they expose API for two-phase commits.

Assuming you have two (or more) connections to distinct PostgreSQL
databases, for example:

.. code:: python

   db_a = DAL('postgres://...')
   db_b = DAL('postgres://...')

In your models or controllers, you can commit them concurrently with:

.. code:: python

   DAL.distributed_transaction_commit(db_a, db_b)

On failure, this function rolls back and raises an ``Exception``.

In controllers, when one action returns, if you have two distinct
connections and you do not call the above function, py4web commits them
separately. This means there is a possibility that one of the commits
succeeds and one fails. The distributed transaction prevents this from
happening.


Copy data from one db into another
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Consider the situation in which you have been using the following
database:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL('sqlite://storage.sqlite')

and you wish to move to another database using a different connection
string:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL('postgres://username:password@localhost/mydb')

Before you switch, you want to move the data and rebuild all the
metadata for the new database. We assume the new database to exist but
we also assume it is empty.


Gotchas
-------

Note on new DAL and adapters
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

.. FIXME: review needed

The source code of the Database Abstraction Layer was completely
rewritten in 2010. While it stays backward compatible, the rewrite made
it more modular and easier to extend. Here we explain the main logic.

The module “dal.py” defines, among other, the following classes.

::

   ConnectionPool
   BaseAdapter extends ConnectionPool
   Row
   DAL
   Reference
   Table
   Expression
   Field
   Query
   Set
   Rows

Their use has been explained in the previous sections, except for
``BaseAdapter``. When the methods of a ``Table`` or ``Set`` object need
to communicate with the database they delegate to methods of the adapter
the task to generate the SQL and or the function call.

For example:

.. code:: python

   db.mytable.insert(myfield='myvalue')

calls

.. code:: python

   Table.insert(myfield='myvalue')

which delegates the adapter by returning:

.. code:: python

   db._adapter.insert(db.mytable, db.mytable._listify(dict(myfield='myvalue')))

Here ``db.mytable._listify`` converts the dict of arguments into a list
of ``(field,value)`` and calls the ``insert`` method of the ``adapter``.
``db._adapter`` does more or less the following:

.. code:: python

   query = db._adapter._insert(db.mytable, list_of_fields)
   db._adapter.execute(query)

where the first line builds the query and the second executes it.

``BaseAdapter`` defines the interface for all adapters.

pyDAL at the moment of writing this book, contains the
following adapters:

::

   SQLiteAdapter extends BaseAdapter
   JDBCSQLiteAdapter extends SQLiteAdapter
   MySQLAdapter extends BaseAdapter
   PostgreSQLAdapter extends BaseAdapter
   JDBCPostgreSQLAdapter extends PostgreSQLAdapter
   OracleAdapter extends BaseAdapter
   MSSQLAdapter extends BaseAdapter
   MSSQL2Adapter extends MSSQLAdapter
   MSSQL3Adapter extends MSSQLAdapter
   MSSQL4Adapter extends MSSQLAdapter
   FireBirdAdapter extends BaseAdapter
   FireBirdEmbeddedAdapter extends FireBirdAdapter
   InformixAdapter extends BaseAdapter
   DB2Adapter extends BaseAdapter
   IngresAdapter extends BaseAdapter
   IngresUnicodeAdapter extends IngresAdapter
   GoogleSQLAdapter extends MySQLAdapter
   NoSQLAdapter extends BaseAdapter
   GoogleDatastoreAdapter extends NoSQLAdapter
   CubridAdapter extends MySQLAdapter (experimental)
   TeradataAdapter extends DB2Adapter (experimental)
   SAPDBAdapter extends BaseAdapter (experimental)
   CouchDBAdapter extends NoSQLAdapter (experimental)
   IMAPAdapter extends NoSQLAdapter (experimental)
   MongoDBAdapter extends NoSQLAdapter (experimental)
   VerticaAdapter extends MSSQLAdapter (experimental)
   SybaseAdapter extends MSSQLAdapter (experimental)

which override the behavior of the ``BaseAdapter``.

Each adapter has more or less this structure:

.. code:: python

   class MySQLAdapter(BaseAdapter):

       # specify a driver to use
       driver = globals().get('pymysql', None)

       # map py4web types into database types
       types = {
           'boolean': 'CHAR(1)',
           'string': 'VARCHAR(%(length)s)',
           'text': 'LONGTEXT',
           ...
           }

       # connect to the database using driver
       def __init__(self, db, uri, pool_size=0, folder=None, db_codec ='UTF-8',
                    credential_decoder=lambda x:x, driver_args={},
                    adapter_args={}):
           # parse uri string and store parameters in driver_args
           ...
           # define a connection function
           def connect(driver_args=driver_args):
               return self.driver.connect(**driver_args)
           # place it in the pool
           self.pool_connection(connect)
           # set optional parameters (after connection)
           self.execute('SET FOREIGN_KEY_CHECKS=1;')
           self.execute("SET sql_mode='NO_BACKSLASH_ESCAPES';")

      # override BaseAdapter methods as needed
      def lastrowid(self, table):
           self.execute('select last_insert_id();')
           return int(self.cursor.fetchone()[0])

Looking at the various adapters as example should be easy to write new
ones.

When ``db`` instance is created:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL('mysql://...')

the prefix in the uri string defines the adapter. The mapping is defined
in the following dictionary also in “dal.py”:

the uri string is then parsed in more detail by the adapter itself.
An updated list of adapters can be obtained as dictionary with

.. code: python

   from pydal.adapters import adapters
   ADAPTERS = adapters.__dict__['_registry_']

For any adapter you can replace the driver with a different one 
globally (not thread safe):

.. code:: python

   import MySQLdb as mysqldb
   from pydal.adapters.mysql import SQLAdapter
   SQLAdapter.driver = mysqldb

i.e. ``mysqldb`` has to be *that module* with a .connect() method. You
can specify optional driver arguments and adapter arguments:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL(..., driver_args={}, adapter_args={})

For recognized adapters you can also simply specify the name in the
``adapter_args``:

.. code:: python

   from pydal.adapters.mysql import MySQL
   assert "mysqldv" in MySQL.drivers
   db = DAL(..., driver_args={}, adapter_args={"driver": "mysqldb"})


SQLite
~~~~~~

SQLite does not support dropping and altering columns. That means that
py4web migrations will work up to a point. If you delete a field from a
table, the column will remain in the database but will be invisible to
py4web. If you decide to reinstate the column, py4web will try re-create
it and fail. In this case you must set ``fake_migrate=True`` so that
metadata is rebuilt without attempting to add the column again. Also,
for the same reason, SQLite is not aware of any change of column
type. If you insert a number in a string field, it will be stored as
string. If you later change the model and replace the type “string” with
type “integer”, SQLite will continue to keep the number as a string and
this may cause problem when you try to extract the data.

SQLite doesn’t have a boolean type. py4web internally maps booleans to a
1 character string, with ‘T’ and ‘F’ representing True and False. The
DAL handles this completely; the abstraction of a true boolean value
works well. But if you are updating the SQLite table with SQL directly,
be aware of the py4web implementation, and avoid using 0 and 1 values.

MySQL
~~~~~

MySQL does not support multiple ALTER TABLE within a single transaction.
This means that any migration process is broken into multiple commits.
If something happens that causes a failure it is possible to break a
migration (the py4web metadata are no longer in sync with the actual
table structure in the database). This is unfortunate but it can be
prevented (migrate one table at the time) or it can be fixed in the
aftermath (revert the py4web model to what corresponds to the table
structure in database, set ``fake_migrate=True`` and after the metadata
has been rebuilt, set ``fake_migrate=False`` and migrate the table
again).

Google SQL
~~~~~~~~~~

Google SQL has the same problems as MySQL and more. In particular table
metadata itself must be stored in the database in a table that is not
migrated by py4web. This is because Google App Engine has a read-only
file system. PY4WEB migrations in Google SQL combined with the MySQL
issue described above can result in metadata corruption. Again, this can
be prevented (by migrating the table at once and then setting
migrate=False so that the metadata table is not accessed any more) or it
can fixed in the aftermath (by accessing the database using the Google
dashboard and deleting any corrupted entry from the table called
``py4web_filesystem``.

MSSQL (Microsoft SQL Server)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

MSSQL < 2012 does not support the SQL OFFSET keyword. Therefore the
database cannot do pagination. When doing a ``limitby=(a, b)`` py4web
will fetch the first ``a + b`` rows and discard the first ``a``. This
may result in a considerable overhead when compared with other database
engines. If you’re using MSSQL >= 2005, the recommended prefix to use is
``mssql3://`` which provides a method to avoid the issue of fetching the
entire non-paginated resultset. If you’re on MSSQL >= 2012, use
``mssql4://`` that uses the
``OFFSET ... ROWS ... FETCH NEXT ... ROWS ONLY`` construct to support
natively pagination without performance hits like other backends. The
``mssql://`` uri also enforces (for historical reasons) the use of
``text`` columns, that are superseeded in more recent versions (from
2005 onwards) by ``varchar(max)``. ``mssql3://`` and ``mssql4://``
should be used if you don’t want to face some limitations of the -
officially deprecated - ``text`` columns.

MSSQL has problems with circular references in tables that have ONDELETE
CASCADE. This is an MSSQL bug and you work around it by setting the
ondelete attribute for all reference fields to “NO ACTION”. You can also
do it once and for all before you define tables:

.. code:: python

   db = DAL('mssql://....')
   for key in db._adapter.types:
       if ' ON DELETE %(on_delete_action)s' in db._adapter.types[key]:
           db._adapter.types[key] = db._adapter.types[key].replace('%(on_delete_action)s', 'NO ACTION')

MSSQL also has problems with arguments passed to the DISTINCT keyword
and therefore while this works,

.. code:: python

   db(query).select(distinct=True)

this does not

.. code:: python

   db(query).select(distinct=db.mytable.myfield)

Oracle
~~~~~~

Oracle also does not support pagination. It does not support neither the
OFFSET nor the LIMIT keywords. PY4WEB achieves pagination by translating
a ``db(...).select(limitby=(a, b))`` into a complex three-way nested
select (as suggested by official Oracle documentation). This works for
simple select but may break for complex selects involving aliased fields
and or joins.

Google NoSQL (Datastore)
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Google NoSQL (Datastore) does not allow joins, left joins, aggregates,
expression, OR involving more than one table, the ‘like’ operator
searches in “text” fields.

Transactions are limited and not provided automatically by py4web (you
need to use the Google API ``run_in_transaction`` which you can look up
in the Google App Engine documentation online).

Google also limits the number of records you can retrieve in each one
query (1000 at the time of writing). On the Google datastore record IDs
are integer but they are not sequential. While on SQL the “list:string”
type is mapped into a “text” type, on the Google Datastore it is mapped
into a ``ListStringProperty``. Similarly “list:integer” and
“list:reference” are mapped into ``ListProperty``. This makes searches
for content inside these fields types more efficient on Google NoSQL
than on SQL databases.
