# py4web documentation
  
In this /doc folder you can see the source files for all the documentation, in RST format. Their translations are
in the /doc/locales folders, in PO format.

When needed, the sources are manually converted to HTML, PDF and EPUB file formats (using the enclosed updateDocs.sh
script). The result is placed in the /apps/_documentation/static folder in order to be read locally by the end users with the _documentation py4web app.
The conversion is made with [Sphinx](https://www.sphinx-doc.org) and the result uses the
[Read the docs style](https://readthedocs.org/)


The updateDocs.sh program needs a Linux/Mac system with the packages
"rsync python3-sphinx python3-sphinx-rtd-theme python3-stemmer python3-git python3-pip python3-virtualenv python3-setuptools"
and the python3 modules "rinohtype pygments".
It accept the **html** parameter (that builds/updates only the html outputs, or the **all** parameters that build also the PDF and EPUB files.
If lauched without any options it displays the help message.

After the updateDocs run, the results are available only locally.
If you use a local git repository and you wish to update the documentation to the remote repository, too, you have to force the changes
because they are not normally allowed by the py4web .gitignore file. In order to do it, you have to issue a 'git add --force apps/_documentation/*' from
the py4web folder


# Translations

If you want to help with translations, you are welcome! A good starting point is this RST cheatsheet https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/docs-how-to-document/master/en-us/WritingReST/CheatSheet.html
and also this tools walkthrough https://docs.typo3.org/m/typo3/docs-how-to-document/master/en-us/ToolsEditRest/Index.html.
We strongly suggest the use of the free multiplatform program POEDIT v2 (https://poedit.net/)


The current translators are listed here:

* Portuguese: Carlos JosÃ© da Costa (https://github.com/yamandu)


## New translation

If your language does not still exist in the documentation, for example the Italian one, you need to build its PO files. Setup a working environment as described before for updatDocs.sh, go to the
/docs folder and run:

make gettext
sphinx-intl update -p _build/gettext -l it

(where 'it' is the language code for Italian).
This will create the PO files to be translated in /docs/locales/it/LC_MESSAGES

After their translation,  you can generate the HTML result as usual with the updateDocs.sh program.

## Update translation

When the english source files will be updated, the translated work will not be lost - but the new strings will appear inside your translated ones.
In order import the updated sources without loosing your previous work, you need to run:

sphinx-build -b gettext . _build/gettext

This creates the updates .pot files on /docs/_build/gettext. 
With poedit you have to load the old translated .po file in your language. Then you use the menu "Catalog" -> "Update from POT file ..." in order to collect the updates from the .pot file.
The new additions / changes will be loaded and marked to be fixed. You can now save the updated PO file and work on it.
