Click on a tab title to expand. Tabs are context dependent. For example,
open tab “Installed Applications” and click on an installed application
to select it. This will create new tabs “Routes”, “Files”, and “Model”
for the selected app.

The “Files” tab allows you to browse the folder that contains the
selected app and edit any file that comprises the app. If you edit a
file you must click on “Reload Apps” under the “Installed Applications”
tab for the change to take effect. If an app fails to load, its
corresponding button is displayed in red. Click on it to see the
corresponding error.
