"py4web comes with a an object Auth and a system of plugins for user "

"The import step is obvious. The second step does not perform any "
"operation other than telling the Auth object which session object to use "

"and, if a user is logged in, the user id is stored in "
"session[‘user’][‘id’]. The db object is used to store persistent info "

"Py4web does not have the concept of groups as web2py does. Experience "
"showed that while that mechanism is powerful it suffers from two "
"problems: it is overkill for most apps, and it is not flexible enough for"
" very complex apps. Py4web provides a general purpose tagging mechanism "
"that allows the developer to tag any record of any table, check for the "
"existence of tags, as well as checking for records containing a tag. "
"Group membership can be thought of a type of tag that we apply to users. "
"Permissions can also be tags. Developer are free to create their own "
"logic on top of the tagging system."

"Here the use case is group based access control where the developer first"
" checks if a user is a member of the ``'manager'`` group, if the user is "
"not a manager (or no one is logged in) py4web redirects to the ``'not "
"authorized url'``. If the user is in the correct group then py4web "
"displays ‘hello manager’:"

"**Important:** ``Tags`` are automatically hierarchical. For example, if a"

"Notice that one table can have multiple associated ``Tags`` objects. The "
