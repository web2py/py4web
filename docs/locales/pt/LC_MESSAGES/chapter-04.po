"A fixture is defined as “a piece of equipment or furniture which is fixed"
" in position in a building or vehicle”. In our case a fixture is "
"something attached to the action that processes an HTTP request in order "
"to produce a response."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-04.rst:9
msgid ""
"When processing any HTTP requests there are some optional operations we "
"may want to perform. For example parse the cookie to look for session "
"information, commit a database transaction, determine the preferred "
"language from the HTTP header and lookup proper internationalization, "
"etc. These operations are optional. Some actions need them and some "
"actions do not. They may also depend on each other. For example, if "
"sessions are stored in the database and our action needs it, we may need "
"to parse the session cookie from the header, pick up a connection from "
"the database connection pool, and - after the action has been executed - "
"save the session back in the database if data has changed."

"PY4WEB fixtures provide a mechanism to specify what an action needs so "
"that py4web can accomplish the required tasks (and skip non required "
"ones) in the most efficient manner. Fixtures make the code efficient and "
"reduce the need for boilerplate code."

"PY4WEB fixtures are similar to WSGI middleware and BottlePy plugin except"

"PY4WEB comes with some pre-defined fixtures for actions that need "
"sessions, database connections, internationalization, authentication, and"
" templates. Their usage will be explained in this chapter. The Developer "
"is also free to add fixtures, for example, to handle a third party "
"template language or third party session logic."

"The Template object is a Fixture. It transforms the ``dict()`` returned "

"By default the session object is stored in a cookie called, signed and "

"In py4web sessions are dictionaries but they are stored using JSON (JWT "

"It is common to want to display “alerts” to the suers. Here we refer to "

" a message to the view because flash messages can have state that must be"

"If a page is redirected after a flash is set, the flash is remembered. "
