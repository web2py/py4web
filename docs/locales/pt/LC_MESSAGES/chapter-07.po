"py4web uses Python for its models, controllers, and views, although it "
"uses a slightly modified Python syntax in the views to allow more "
"readable code without imposing any restrictions on proper Python usage."

"py4web uses ``[[ ... ]]`` to escape Python code embedded in HTML. The "
"advantage of using square brackets instead of angle brackets is that it’s"
" transparent to all common HTML editors. This allows the developer to use"
" those editors to create py4web views."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-07.rst:13
msgid ""
"Since the developer is embedding Python code into HTML, the document "
"should be indented according to HTML rules, and not Python rules. "
"Therefore, we allow unindented Python inside the ``[[ ... ]]`` tags. "
"Since Python normally uses indentation to delimit blocks of code, we need"
" a different way to delimit them; this is why the py4web template "
"language makes use of the Python keyword ``pass``."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-07.rst:20
msgid ""
"A code block starts with a line ending with a colon and ends with a line "
"beginning with ``pass``. The keyword ``pass`` is not necessary when the "
"end of the block is obvious from the context."

"Note that ``pass`` is a Python keyword, not a py4web keyword. Some Python"
" editors, such as Emacs, use the keyword ``pass`` to signify the division"
" of blocks and use it to re-indent code automatically."

"When there is an error in a py4web view, the error report shows the "
"generated view code, not the actual view as written by the developer. "
"This helps the developer debug the code by highlighting the actual code "
"that is executed (which is something that can be debugged with an HTML "
"editor or the DOM inspector of the browser)."

"Variables injected into the HTML in this way are escaped by default. The "

msgid ""
"upon evaluation, the ``H1`` object and its components are recursively "
"serialized, escaped and written to the response body. The tags generated "
"by ``H1`` and inner HTML are not escaped. This mechanism guarantees that "
"all text — and only text — displayed on the web page is always escaped, "
"thus preventing XSS vulnerabilities. At the same time, the code is simple"
" and easy to debug."

"The method ``response.write(obj, escape=True)`` takes two arguments, the "
"object to be written and whether it has to be escaped (set to ``True`` by"
" default). If ``obj`` has an ``.xml()`` method, it is called and the "
"result written to the response body (the ``escape`` argument is ignored)."
" Otherwise it uses the object’s ``__str__`` method to serialize it and, "
"if the escape argument is ``True``, escapes it. All built-in helper "
"objects (``H1`` in the example) are objects that know how to serialize "
"themselves via the ``.xml()`` method."
