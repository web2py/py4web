"PY4WEB is a web framework for rapid development of efficient database "
"driven web applications. It is an evolution of the popular web2py "
"framework but much faster and slicker. Its internal design has been much "
"simplified compared to web2py."
msgstr "O PY4WEB é um web framework para o desenvolvimento rápido de aplicativos web eficientes orientados a bancos de dados. É uma evolução do popular framework Web2py, mas muito mais rápido e mais rápido. Seu design interno foi muito simplificado em comparação com o web2py.

"PY4WEB can be seen as a competitor of other frameworks like Django or "
"Flask, and it can indeed serve the same purpose. Yet PY4WEB aims to "
"provide a larger feature set out of the box and reduce the development "
"time of new apps."

"From a historical perspective our story starts in 2007 when web2py was "
"first released. web2py was designed to provide an all-inclusive solution "
"for web development: one zip file containing the Python interpreter, the "
"framework, a web based IDE, and a collection of battle-tested packages "
"that work well together. In many ways web2py has been immensely "
"successful. Web2py succeeded in providing a low barrier of entry for new "
"developers, a very secure development platform, and remains backwards "
"compatible until today."

"Web2py always suffered from one problem: its monolithic design. The most "
"experienced Python developers did not understand how to use its "
"components outside of the framework and how to use third party components"
" within the framework. This was for good reason, as we did not care too "
"much about them. We thought of web2py as a perfect tool that did not have"
" to be broken into pieces because that would compromise its security. It "
"turned out that we were wrong, and playing well with others is important."
" Hence, in the last two years we worked on three fronts:"

msgid "We ported web2py to Python 3."

msgid "We broke web2py into modules that can be used independently."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:34
msgid ""
"We reassembled some of those modules into a new more modular framework … "
"PY4WEB."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:37
msgid ""
"PY4WEB is more than a repackaging of those modules. It is a complete "
"redesign. It uses some of the web2py modules, but not all of them. In "
"some cases, it uses other and better modules. Some functionality was "
"removed and some was added. We tried to preserve most of the syntax and "
"features that experienced web2py users loved. Here is a more explicit "
"list:"

msgid "PY4WEB, unlike web2py, requires Python 3."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:45

"PY4WEB, unlike web2py, can be installed using pip and its dependencies "
"are managed using requirements.txt."

"PY4WEB apps are regular Python modules. This is very different to web2py."
" In particular, we ditched the custom importer, and we rely now "
"exclusively on the regular Python import mechanism."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:50
msgid ""
"PY4WEB, like web2py, can serve multiple applications concurrently, as "
"long as the apps are submodules of the apps module."

"PY4WEB, unlike web2py, is based on bottlepy and in particular uses the "
"Bottle request object and the Bottle routing mechanism."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:54
msgid ""
"PY4WEB, unlike web2py, does not create a new environment at every "
"request. It introduces the concept of fixtures to explicitly declare "
"which objects need to be re-initialized when a new http request is "
"processed. This makes it much faster."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:58
msgid ""
"PY4WEB, has a new sesson object which, like web2py’s, provides strong "
"security and encryption of the session data, but sessions are no longer "
"stored in the file system - which created performance issues. It provides"
" sessions in cookies, in redis, in memcache, or in database. We also "
"limited session data to objects that are json serializable."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:64
msgid ""
"PY4WEB, like web2py, has a built-in ticketing system but, unlike web2py, "
"this system is global and not per app. Tickets are no longer stored in "
"the filesystem with the individual apps. They are stored in a single "
"database."

"PY4WEB, like web2py, is based on pydal but uses some new features of "
"pydal (RESTAPI)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:70
msgid ""
"PY4WEB, like web2py, uses the yatl template language but defaults to "
"square brackets delimiters to avoid conflicts with model JS frameworks, "
"such as Vue.js and angular.js. Yatl includes a subset of the web2py "
"helpers."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:74
msgid ""
"PY4WEB, unlike web2py, uses the pluralization library for "
"internationalization. In practice, this exposes an object T very similar "
"to web2py’s T but it provides better caching and more flexible "
"pluralization capabilities."

"PY4WEB comes with a Dashboard APP that replaces web2py’s admin. This is a"
" web IDE for uploading/managing/editing apps."

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:80

"PY4WEB’s Dashboard includes a web based database interface. This replaces"
" the appadmin functionality of web2py."

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:82
msgid ""
"PY4WEB comes with a Form object that is similar to web2py’s SQLFORM but "
"it is much simpler and faster. The syntax is the same. This has been "
"provided in order to help users port existing apps; but PY4WEB encourages"
" using API based forms over postbacks."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:86
msgid ""
"PY4WEB comes with an Auth object that replaces the web2py one. It is more"
" modular and easier to extend. Out of the box, it provides the basic "
"functionality of register, login, logout, change password, request change"
" password, edit profile as well as integration with PAM, SAML2, LDAP, "
"OAUTH2 (google, facebook, and twitter)."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:91
msgid ""
"PY4WEB comes with some utilites like “tags”, for instance, which allows "
"adding searchable tags to any database table. It can be used, for "
"example, to tag users with groups and search users by groups and apply "
"permissions based on membership."
msgstr ""

#: ../../chapter-00.rst:95
msgid ""
"PY4WEB comes with with some custom Vue.js components designed to interact"
" with the PyDAL RESTAPI, and with PY4WEB in general. These APIs are "
"designed to allow the server to set policies about which operations a "
"client is allowed to perform, but give the client flexibility within "
"those constraints. The two main components are mtable (which provides a "
"web based interface to the database similar to web2py’s grid) and auth (a"
" customizable interface to the Auth API)."
