"This is not a real installation, because you just copy a bunch of files "

"solution, especially for newbies or students, because it does not require"
" Python pre-installed on your system nor administrative rights. On the "
"other hand, it’s experimental, it could contain an old py4web release and"
" it is quite difficult to add other functionalities to it."
