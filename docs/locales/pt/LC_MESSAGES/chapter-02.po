"We've made our best to make PY4WEB simple and clean. But you know, modern"
" web programming is a daunting task. It requires an open mind, able to "
"jump frequently (without being lost!) from python to HTML to javascript "
"to css and even database management. But don't be scared, in this manual "
"we'll assist you side by side in this journey. And there are many other "
"valuable resources that we're going to show you."

"This manual is the Reference Manual for py4web. It's available online at "
"https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/index.html, where you'll also "
"find the PDF and EBOOK version, in multiple languages. It was originally "
"written with the MarkMin format (similar to MarkDown) and displayed in "
"HTML with a custom py4web application. In 2020 we decided to convert its "
"sources to the RST format which is better suited for technical "
"documentation. Using Sphinx and the ReadTheDocs style we are now able to "
"achieve high quality outputs."

"In the following chapters you will start coding on your computer. We "

"efficiently and safely. Even for running simple examples and "
"experimenting a little, we strongly suggest to use an **Integrated "
"Development Environment** (IDE). This will make your programming "
"experience much better, allowing syntax checking, linting and visual "
"debugging. Nowadays there are two free and multiplatform main choices: "
"Microsoft Visual Studio Code aka `VScode "
