# [py4web](http://py4web.com)

[![Build Status](https://img.shields.io/travis/web2py/py4web/master.svg?style=flat-square&label=Travis-CI)](https://travis-ci.org/web2py/py4web)

## Try me (from pip)

```
python3 -m pip install -U py4web --no-cache-dir --user
py4web-start apps
open http://localhost:8000/todo/index
```

(The apps folder will be created with some apps inside)

## Try me (from source)

```
git clone https://github.com/web2py/py4web.git
cd py4web 
python3 -m pip install -r requirements.txt
./py4web-start.py apps
open http://localhost:8000/todo/index
```

## Try me (install from source)

```
git clone https://github.com/web2py/py4web.git
cd py4web
make assets
make test
make install
py4web-start.py apps
open http://localhost:8000/todo/index
```

Notice "py4web-start" uses the pip installed py4web, "./py4web-start.py" uses the local one. Do not get confused.
Also notice when installing from source the content of py4web/assets is missing and it is created by make assets.

## Tell me more

- this is a work in progress and not stable yet but close to being stable
- python3 only
- uses https://github.com/web2py/pydal (same DAL as web2py)
- uses https://github.com/web2py/yatl (same as web2py but defaults to [[...]] instead of {{...}} delimiters)
- uses the same validators as web2py (they are in pyDAL)
- uses the very similar helpers to web2py (A, DIV, SPAN, etc.)
- uses https://github.com/web2py/pluralize for i18n and pluralization
- request, response, abort are from https://bottlepy.org
- HTTP and redirect are our own objects
- like web2py, it supports static asset management /{appname}/static/_0.0.0/{path}
- implements sessions in cookies (jwt encrypted), db, memcache, redis and custom
- implements a cache.memoize (Ram cache with O(1) access) [Memoize](https://dbader.org/blog/python-memoization)
- supports multiple apps under apps folder (same as web2py)
- unlike web2py does not use a custom importer or eval
- admin has been replaced by a _dashboard (90% done)
- appadmin has been replaced by dbadmin (within dashboard) (90% done)
- auth logic is implemented via a "auth" vue.js custom component (90% done)
- SQLFORM has been replaced by py4web/utils/form.py
- SQLFORM.grid was been replaced by a "mtable" vue.js custom component (90% done)
- there are not enough tests
- it is not as stable as web2py yet
- it is 10-20x faster than web2py

## Storing _dashboard password 

When py4web starts it asks for a _dashboard password and stores its pdkdf2 hash 
in password.txt, in the working folder. It will not ask again unless the file is deleted. 
If the ``--dashboard_mode`` is ``demo`` or ``none`` it will not ask.
If you want to store it somewhere else, you can specify a name with ``--password_file``.

You can create the file yourself with:

```
$ python3 -c "from pydal.validators import CRYPT; open('password.txt','w').write(str(CRYPT()(input('password:'))[0]))"
password: *****
```

```

The wsgi function takes arguments with the same name as the command line arguments.
