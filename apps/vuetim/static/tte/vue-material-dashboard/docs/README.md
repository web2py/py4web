## Short Description and Usage

Vue Material Dashboard is a beautiful resource built over [Vue Material](https://vuematerial.io/) and [Vuejs](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/). It will help you get started developing dashboards in no time. Vue Material Dashboard is the official Vuejs version of the Original [Material Dashboard](https://www.creative-tim.com/product/material-dashboard). Using the Dashboard is pretty simple but requires basic knowledge of Javascript, [Vue](https://vuejs.org/v2/guide/) and [Vue-Router](https://router.vuejs.org/en/).

### Getting Started
- Install Nodejs from [Nodejs Official Page](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- Open your terminal
- Navigate to the project
- Run `npm install` or `yarn install` if you use [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/en/)
- Run `npm run dev` or `yarn serve` to start a local development server
- A new tab will be opened in your browser

You can also run additional npm tasks such as
- `npm run build` to build your app for production
- `npm run lint` to run linting.

### Vue-cli

We used the latest 3.x [Vue CLI](https://github.com/vuejs/vue-cli) which aims to reduce project configuration
to as little as possible. Almost everything is inside `package.json` + some other related files such as
`babel.config.js`, `.eslintrc.js` and `postcss.config.js`

### Element-UI

  Vue Material Dashboard also uses [element-ui](https://vuematerial.io/ui-elements/elevation) components and restyles them to achieve consistent and homogenous interface with the existing custom components and general UI of the dashboard.
