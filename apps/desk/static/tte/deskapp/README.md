DeskApp Admin is a free to use Bootstrap 4 admin template. This template uses the default Bootstrap 4 styles along with a variety of powerful jQuery plugins and tools to create a powerful framework for creating admin panels or back-end dashboards.

Theme uses several libraries for charts, calendar, text forms, date range, upload area, form autocomplete, range slider, progress bars, notifications and much more.
