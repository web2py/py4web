From web2py to py4web
=====================

This chapter is dedicated to help users for porting old web2py applications to py4web.

Web2py and py4web share many similarities and some differences. For example they share the same
database abstraction layer (pyDAL) which means pydal table definitions and queries are identical
between the two frameworks. They also share the same template language with the minor caveat that
web2py defaults to `{{...}}` delimiters while py4web defaults to `[[...]]` delimiters. They also
share the same validators, part of pyDAL, and very similar helpers. The py4web ones are a
lighter/faster/minimalist re-implementation but they serve the same purpose and support a very
similar syntax. They both provide a `Form` object (equivalent to `SQLFORM` in web2py) and a `Grid`
object (equivalent to `SQLFORM.grid` in web2py). They both provide a `XML` object that can sanitize
HTML and `URL` helper to generate URL. They both can raise `HTTP` to return non-200 OK pages. They
both provide an `Auth` object that can generate register/login/change password/lost password/edit
profile forms. Both web2py and py4web track and log all errors.

Some of the main differences are the following:

- web2py works with both Python 2.6+ and 3.6+, while py4web runs on Python 3.6+ only. So, if your
  old web2py application is still using Python 2, your first step involves migrating it to at
  least Python 3.6, better if the latest 3.8.

- web2py apps consist of collection of files which are executed at every HTTP request (using a
  custom importer, in a predetermined order). In py4web apps are regular python modules that are
  imported automatically by the frameworks. By the way, this makes possible the use of standard
  python debuggers (even inside the most used IDEs).

- In web2py every app has a fixed folder structure. A function is an action if and only if it is
  defined in a ``controllers/*.py`` file. py4web is much less constraining. In py4web an app must
  have an entry point ``__init__.py`` and a ``static`` folder. Every other convention such as the
  location of templates, uploaded files, translation files, sessions, etc. is user specified.

- In web2py the scaffolding app (the blue print for creating new apps) is called “welcome”. In
  py4web it is called “_scaffold”. _scaffold contains a “settings.py” file and a “common.py”.
  The latter provides an example of how to enable Auth and configure all the options for the
  specific app. _scaffold has also a “model.py” file and a “controller.py” file but, unlike
  web2py, those files are not treated in any special manner. Their names follow a convention
  (not enforced by the framework) and they are imported by the `__init__.py` file as for any
  regular python module.

- In web2py every function in ``controllers/*.py`` is an action. In py4web a function is an action
  if it has the ``@action("...")`` decorator. That means that actions can be defined anywhere. The
  admin interface will help you locate where a particular action is defined.

- In web2py the mapping between URLs and file/function names is automatic but it can be
  overwritten in “routes.py” (like in Django). In py4web the mapping is specified in the decorator
  as in `@action('my_url_path')` (like in Bottle and Flask). Notice that if the path starts with
  “/” it is assumed to be an absolute path. If not, it is assumed to be relative and prepended by
  the “/{appname}/” prefix. Also, if the path ends with “/index”, the latter postfix is assumed
  to be optional.

- In web2py the path extension matters and “http://*.html” is expected to return HTML while
  “http://*.json” is expected to return JSON, etc. In py4web there is no such convention. If the
  action returns a dict() and has a template, the dict() will be rendered by the template, else it
  will be rendered in JSON. More complex behavior can be accomplished using decorators.

- In web2py there are many wrappers around each action and, for example, they could handle sessions,
  pluralization, database connections, and more whether the action needs it or not. This makes
  web2py performances hard to compare with other frameworks. In py4web everything is optional and
  features must be enabled and configured for each action using the ``@action.uses(...)`` decorator.
  The arguments of ``@action.uses(...)`` are called fixtures in analogy with the fixtures in a
  house. They add functionality by providing preprocessing and postprocessing to the action. For
  example ``@action.uses(session, T, db, flash)`` indicates that the action needs to use session,
  internationalization/pluralization (T), the database (db), and carry on state for flash messages
  upon redirection.

- web2py uses its own request/response objects. py4web uses the request/response objects from the
  underlying Bottle framework. While this may change in the future we are committed to keep them
  compatible with Bottle because of its excellent documentation. Bottle also handles for py4web
  the interface with the web server, routing, partial requests, if modified since, and file
  streaming.

- Both web2py and py4web use the same pyDAL therefore tables are defined using the same exact
  syntax, and so do queries. In web2py tables are re-defined at every HTTP
  request, when the entire models are executed. In py4web only the action is executed for every
  HTTP request, while the code defined outside of actions is only executed at startup. That makes
  py4web much faster, in particular when there are many tables. The downside of this approach is
  that the developer should be careful to never override pyDAL variables inside action or in any
  way that depends on the content of the request object, else the code is not thread safe. The
  only variables that can be changed at will are the following field attributes: readable,
  writable, requires, update, default. All the others are for practical purposes to be
  considered global and non thread safe. This is also the reason that makes using
  :ref:`Lazy Tables` with py4web useless and even dangerous.

- Both web2py and pyweb have an Auth object which serve the same purpose. Both objects have the
  ability to generate forms pretty much in the same manner. The py4web ones is defined to be more
  modular and extensible and support both Forms and APIs, but it lacks the `auth.requires_*`
  decorators and group membership/permissions. This does not mean that the feature is not
  available. In fact py4web is even more powerful and that is why the syntax is different. While
  the web2py Auth objects tries to do everything, the corresponding py4web object is only in
  charge of establishing the identity of a user, not what the user can do. The latter can be
  achieved by attaching Tags to users. So group membership is assigned by labeling users with
  the Tags of the groups they belong to and checking permissions based on the user tags. Py4web
  provides a mechanism for assigning and checking tags efficiently to any object, including but
  not limited to, users.

- Web2py comes with the Rocket web server. py4web at the time of writing defaults to the Tornado
  web server but this may change.
