<h1>O que é py4web?<a class="headerlink" href="#what-is-py4web" title="Link permanente para este título">¶</a></h1>
<p>PY4WEB is a web framework for rapid development of efficient database
driven web applications. It is an evolution of the popular web2py
framework but much faster and slicker. Its internal design has been much
simplified compared to web2py.</p>
<p>PY4WEB can be seen as a competitor of other frameworks like Django or
Flask, and it can indeed serve the same purpose. Yet PY4WEB aims to
provide a larger feature set out of the box and reduce the development
time of new apps.</p>
<p>From a historical perspective our story starts in 2007 when web2py was
first released. web2py was designed to provide an all-inclusive solution
for web development: one zip file containing the Python interpreter, the
framework, a web based IDE, and a collection of battle-tested packages
that work well together. In many ways web2py has been immensely
successful. Web2py succeeded in providing a low barrier of entry for new
developers, a very secure development platform, and remains backwards
compatible until today.</p>
<p>Web2py always suffered from one problem: its monolithic design. The most
experienced Python developers did not understand how to use its
components outside of the framework and how to use third party
components within the framework. This was for good reason, as we did not
care too much about them. We thought of web2py as a perfect tool that
did not have to be broken into pieces because that would compromise its
security. It turned out that we were wrong, and playing well with others
is important. Hence, since 2015 we worked on three fronts:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>We ported web2py to Python 3.</p></li>
<li><p>We broke web2py into modules that can be used independently.</p></li>
<li><p>We reassembled some of those modules into a new more modular
framework … PY4WEB.</p></li>
</ul>
<p>PY4WEB is more than a repackaging of those modules. It is a complete
redesign. It uses some of the web2py modules, but not all of them. In
some cases, it uses other and better modules. Some functionality was
removed and some was added. We tried to preserve most of the syntax and
features that experienced web2py users loved. Here is a more explicit
list:</p>
<ul class="simple">
<li><p>PY4WEB, unlike web2py, requires Python 3.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB, unlike web2py, can be installed using pip and its
dependencies are managed using requirements.txt.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB apps are regular Python modules. This is very different to
web2py. In particular, we ditched the custom importer, and we rely
now exclusively on the regular Python import mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB, like web2py, can serve multiple applications concurrently, as
long as the apps are submodules of the apps module.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB, unlike web2py, is based on bottlepy and in particular uses
the Bottle request object and the Bottle routing mechanism.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB, unlike web2py, does not create a new environment at every
request. It introduces the concept of fixtures to explicitly declare
which objects need to be re-initialized when a new http request is
processed. This makes it much faster.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB, has a new sesson object which, like web2py’s, provides strong
security and encryption of the session data, but sessions are no
longer stored in the file system - which created performance issues.
It provides sessions in cookies, in redis, in memcache, or in
database. We also limited session data to objects that are json
serializable.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB, like web2py, has a built-in ticketing system but, unlike
web2py, this system is global and not per app. Tickets are no longer
stored in the filesystem with the individual apps. They are stored in
a single database.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB, like web2py, is based on pydal but uses some new features of
pydal (RESTAPI).</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB, like web2py, uses the yatl template language but defaults to
square brackets delimiters to avoid conflicts with model JS
frameworks, such as Vue.js and angular.js. Yatl includes a subset of
the web2py helpers.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB, unlike web2py, uses the pluralization library for
internationalization. In practice, this exposes an object T very
similar to web2py’s T but it provides better caching and more
flexible pluralization capabilities.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB comes with a Dashboard APP that replaces web2py’s admin. This
is a web IDE for uploading/managing/editing apps.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB’s Dashboard includes a web based database interface. This
replaces the appadmin functionality of web2py.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB comes with a Form object that is similar to web2py’s SQLFORM
but it is much simpler and faster. The syntax is the same. This has
been provided in order to help users port existing apps; but PY4WEB
encourages using API based forms over postbacks.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB comes with an Auth object that replaces the web2py one. It is
more modular and easier to extend. Out of the box, it provides the
basic functionality of register, login, logout, change password,
request change password, edit profile as well as integration with
PAM, SAML2, LDAP, OAUTH2 (google, facebook, and twitter).</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB comes with some utilites like “tags”, for instance, which
allows adding searchable tags to any database table. It can be used,
for example, to tag users with groups and search users by groups and
apply permissions based on membership.</p></li>
<li><p>PY4WEB comes with with some custom Vue.js components designed to
interact with the PyDAL RESTAPI, and with PY4WEB in general. These
APIs are designed to allow the server to set policies about which
operations a client is allowed to perform, but give the client
flexibility within those constraints. The two main components are
mtable (which provides a web based interface to the database similar
to web2py’s grid) and auth (a customizable interface to the Auth
API).</p></li>
</ul>
<p>The goal of PY4WEB is and remains the same as web2py’s: to make web
development easy and accessible, while producing applications that are
fast and secure.</p>
