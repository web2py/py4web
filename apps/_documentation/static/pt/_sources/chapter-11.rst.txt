Pluralize
---------

Pluralize is a Python library for Internationalization (i18n) and
Pluralization (p10n).

The library assumes a folder (for exaple “translations”) that contains
files like:

::

   it.json
   it-IT.json
   fr.json
   fr-FR.json
   (etc)

Each file has the following structure, for example for Italian
(it.json):

::

   {"dog": {"0": "no cane", "1": "un cane", "2": "{n} cani", "10": "tantissimi cani"}}

The top level keys are the expressions to be translated and the
associated value/dictionary maps a number to a translation. Different
translations correspond to different plural forms of the expression,

Here is another example for the word “bed” in Czech

::

   {"bed": {"0": "no postel", "1": "postel", "2": "postele", "5": "postelí"}}

To translate and pluralize a string “dog” one simply warps the string in
the T operator as follows:

::

   >>> from pluralize import Translator
   >>> T = Translator('translations')
   >>> dog = T("dog")
   >>> print(dog)
   dog
   >>> T.select('it')
   >>> print(dog)
   un cane
   >>> print(dog.format(n=0))
   no cane
   >>> print(dog.format(n=1))
   un cane
   >>> print(dog.format(n=5))
   5 cani
   >>> print(dog.format(n=20))
   tantissimi cani

The string can contain multiple placeholders but the {n} placeholder is
special because the variable called “n” is used to determine the
pluralization by best match (max dict key <= n).

T(…) objects can be added together with each other and with string, like
regular strings.

T.select(s) can parse a string s following the HTTP accept language
format.

Update the translation files
----------------------------

Find all strings wrapped in T(…) in .py, .html, and .js files:

::

   matches = T.find_matches('path/to/app/folder')

Add newly discovered entries in all supported languages

::

   T.update_languages(matches)

Add a new supported language (for example german, “de”)

::

   T.languages['de'] = {}

Make sure all languages contain the same origin expressions

::

   known_expressions = set()
   for language in T.languages.values():
       for expression in language:
           known_expressions.add(expression)
   T.update_languages(known_expressions))

Finally save the changes:

::

   T.save('translations')
