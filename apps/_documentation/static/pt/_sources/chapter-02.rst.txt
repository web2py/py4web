Help, resources and hints
=========================

We've made our best to make PY4WEB simple and clean. But you know, modern web programming is a daunting task. It requires an open mind, able to
jump frequently (without being lost!) from python to HTML to javascript to css and even database management. 
But don't be scared, in this manual we'll assist you side by side in this journey. And there are many other valuable resources that we're going to show you.


Resources
=========

This manual
-----------

This manual is the Reference Manual for py4web. It's available online at https://py4web.com/_documentation/static/index.html, where you'll also find the PDF
and EBOOK version, in multiple languages. 
It was originally written with the MarkMin format (similar to MarkDown) and displayed in HTML with a custom py4web application. In 2020 we decided to
convert its sources to the RST format which is better suited for technical documentation. Using Sphinx and the ReadTheDocs style we are now able to achieve
high quality outputs.


The Google group
----------------

There is a dedicated mailing list hosted on Google Groups, see https://groups.google.com/g/py4web. This is the main source of discussions for developers and
simple users. For any problem you should face, this is the right place to search for a hint or a solution.

The chat on IRC
---------------

We also use to chat sometime on IRC (Internet Relay Chat, which is an old-style text only chat). You can freely join us at https://webchat.freenode.net/#py4web.
From time to time we also use it to host a scheduled public chat, where you can write and read live questions to developers.
Transcripts of them are then available on the mailing list.


Tutorials and video
-------------------

There are some tutorials and videos if you like them. Search for them on `YouTube <https://www.youtube.com/results?search_query=py4web>`__.
There is also available a good free `course by Luca de Alfaro <https://sites.google.com/a/ucsc.edu/luca/classes/cmps-183-hypermedia-and-the-web/cse-183-spring-2020>`__ at UC Santa Cruz. 


The sources on GitHub
---------------------

Py4web is Open Source, with a BSD v3 licence. It's hosted on GitHub at https://github.com/web2py/py4web, where you can read and study all of its internal details.


Hints and tips
==============

This paragraph is dedicated to preliminary hints, suggestions and tips that could be helpful to know before starting to learn py4web.


Prerequisites
-------------

In order to understand py4web you need at least a basic python knowledge. There are many books, courses and tutorials available on the web - choose what's best for you.
The python's decorators, in particular, are a milestone of any python web framework and you have to fully understand it.

A modern python workplace
-------------------------

In the following chapters you will start coding on your computer. We suggest you to setup a modern python workplace if you plan to do it efficiently and safely.
Even for running simple examples and experimenting a little, we strongly suggest to use an **Integrated Development Environment** (IDE). This will make your programming experience much better, allowing syntax checking, linting and visual debugging.
Nowadays there are two free and multiplatform main choices: Microsoft Visual Studio Code aka `VScode <https://code.visualstudio.com/>`__ and
JetBrains `PyCharm <https://www.jetbrains.com/pycharm/>`__.

When you'll start to deal with more complex programs and need reliability, we also suggest to:  


   * use virtual environments (also called **virtualenv**, see `here <https://docs.python.org/3.7/tutorial/venv.html>`__ for an introduction). In a complex workplace this will avoid to be messed up with other python programs and modules
   * use a Concurrent Versions System (**CVS**). Keeping track of your program's changes is highly valuable - along with backups it will save your computing life! Git and GitHub are the current standards.
   

Debugging py4web with VScode
----------------------------

You need to edit the vscode launch.json configuration file by adding the variable ``"gevent": true``. Also, on the same file you can add ``"args": ["run", "apps"]`` in order to run py4web.py directly.

Debugging py4web with PyCharm
-----------------------------

In PyCharm, enable Settings | Build, Execution, Deployment | Python Debugger | Gevent compatible.


How to contribute
=================

We need help from everyone: support our efforts! You can just partecipate in the Google group trying to answer other's questions, submit bugs using or create pull requests on the GitHub
repository.

If you wish to correct and expand this manual, or even translate it in a new foreign language, you can read all the needed information directly on the
`specific README <https://github.com/web2py/py4web/blob/master/docs/README.md>`__ on GitHub.
